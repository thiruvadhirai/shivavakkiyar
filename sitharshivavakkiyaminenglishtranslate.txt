Protection  
When the rare Namachivayam became the beginning and the end  
The mantra that the six hundred and twelve gods spoke that day  
I will tell you the sacred words of Shiva representing the writing of the sun  
All faults, sins, and impurities will run far away.

With a darkened face, touch with reverence the divine sacred throne  
To understand the books of arts and the wisdom that comes to mind  
Great men and small men, all those who have learned and realized  
Must endure mistakes and recite like a ghost.

Character Level
			
In the syllable "ஆ", the universe and the infinite exist  
In the syllable "ஆ", the three primes originated  
In the syllable "ஆ", the vowels "அ" and "ம" reside  
In the syllable "ஆ", nothing is absent or incomplete.

Exemption from duty
			
Running and running, the contaminated test  
From country to country, from day to day, has passed away  
Withered, withered, mankind has dwindled  
Millions and millions, the countless counted millions.

Yoga pose
			
The air that flows in the refined land  
If you can hold it in mind, you can undertake the crowning  
The elders and the kings will also redouble their efforts  
The gracious feet of the Lord, the mother’s feet are the truth.

State of Matter
			
The man who wants to take away a well-shaped girl by force,  
He must be struck down before him.  
When the mediator came and called, this good body,  
He would just take the heat and go away, giving a pair of bangles.  
[Nanduthal - desire; mediator - Eman]

State of wisdom
			
I did not know what was within me  
After knowing what was within me  
Who is capable of seeing what was within me?  
I realized what was within me.
			
6
			

		
I never found anything to think of except you, there is no one else,  
Is it an illusion to stand as a thought and a forgetfulness?  
As everything and as eternity, before beginning, as the beginningless,  
Within me you, within you me, we exist as one, Thenggane.
			
7
			

		
You are the earth and you are the sky, you are the seven seas;  
You are the thought, you are the letters, you are the composed word letters;  
You are the eyes, you are the jewels, you are the doll dancing in the eyes—  
Grant your grace so that the path we stand on is firm and lasting.
			
8
			

		
Not rare, not common, beyond and beyond that  
The reason for crossing darkness, redness, and whiteness  
Neither big nor small, the bonded ones  
Distance and distance beyond difficulty.
			
9
			

		
The evening dusk and the sacred bathing at the confluence,  
Charitable deeds, austerities, and virtues,  
The harvest of thoughts, knowledge, and the daily mantra  
Is the name of Endhairama, Rama Rama Rama.
			
10
			

		
The mantra that frees from the sins of the five great sins  
The poor who repeat this believing it to be the ultimate  
Will never be troubled; a good mantra for themselves  
This is the name Ram Ram Rama called so.
			
11
			

		
What is mine? What is yours? What stands in the middle?  
What belongs to the king? What belongs to the teacher? O servants who speak!  
What is the meaning? What is the destruction? Here and there, beyond there,  
What is the essence? Rama Rama, the name that is Rama!
			
12
			

		
Yoga Position
			
Sattanatha Pattarai who recites scriptures!  
When the root decay comes, will the Vedas come to help?  
Like a counterfeit coin, can you spit and scatter it, O brave one?  
What are the diseases of the scriptures? Sattimuthu Siddhiyar!
			
13
			

		
Chant all four Vedas, understand the path of wisdom.  
Perform your actions mixed with milk and ghee, understand!  
Those who have tasted the flavor dwell within,  
You will call it time, but even in dreams, it is not so.
			
14
			

		
			
			A tradition without knowledge has no top or bottom  
			How can a palace be built without a foundation?  
			The scoundrels who sell their parents and become slaves!  
			There is no wise man without knowledge; there is none, none at all.
			
15
			

		
The orphaned mantra that has not faltered even after fifty-three times,  
If you ponder it in your heart and chant with devotion,  
Even if one hundred crore sinful deeds are committed,  
They will dissolve like cotton, this is what the four truths declare.
			
16
			

		
Andavasal thousand, Prasandavasal thousand  
Six hundred and twenty crore, Yaanavasal thousand  
Indavasal, Ezhavaasal, Ekaboga Maanathai  
Empran Irukkumvaasal, who else can see all?
			
17
			

		
Saama, the four Vedas, and all scriptures  
Even if chanted together, you will not know Shiva.  
When the desire disease leaves and you realize within your heart,  
Our Lord will be like a healing wound!
			
18
			

		
Because one star in the constellation is a Sannapinnal,
How many humans are there in the world, Mangimala?
If you disregard the constellation and cannot blow the star,
Together with the lovely children of Kongai and Mangai, living together will happen.
			
19
			

		
The five elements personified read the five letters born from the five letters and grow.
In the five letters, one letter is known and told by the great!
The Lord dances in the temple, chanting "Anjala Anjal"!
			
20
			

		
Fear, fear, fear is nothing but orphanhood!  
Isn't it shivering, the pitiable ones shudder!  
If you fear in your heart and stand still without moving  
There is no fear, no healing; it appears as orphanhood!
			
21
			

		
You build length and breadth, you construct long doors,  
Were those people happy who said they wanted to live?  
When the sound of the tide came, they stopped with folded hands  
There is desire, there is the seen path, the mother’s path is the truth!
			
22
			

		
Whenever there is a stream, the water may flow and wander;
Whenever there is a stream, one can be certain;
When the stream has ceased, there is no shade outside,
No dance, no decoration, no one exists—everything is gone!
			
23
			

		
Slavery status
			
Taking a house as a task and lying with the truth  
People call it the surroundings of the dead  
Among the middlemen who have gained fame, if you invite with a palm leaf  
The body that flees will not find that place!
			
24
			

		
Production status
			
Brother, orphan, before being an orphan  
Before a girl and a boy are born  
On the day when the seed of the eye nests in the womb  
How did the earthlings and sky dwellers come into being?
			
25
			

		
Knowledge Level
			
How many multicolored flowers did the ancient one pluck and scatter?  
How many spells have been lost in vain?  
How many have died when hunted like prey?  
How many temples have been surrounded again?
			
26
			

		
Those wise ones who know and realize the position of the underscore,  
Who is able to know the inherent nature of the well-established, experienced reality?  
Without the knowledge of the wind-knowledge essence, there is no way to explain it otherwise,  
One dare not take the found temple as a god.
			
27
			

		
They say far, far away, the lazy ones  
The sky they see and the vast heavens spreading everywhere  
The villages, towns, forests, and hill tribes work hard searching!  
Stand firm knowing and understanding straight within you!
			
28
			

		
Gold is one, Rupees are many, each having different qualities  
Thanmal, Sengal, and Eesan were the best southern ones  
Wings speak, shining men  
Our name that has stood everywhere, this very name is our name!
			
29
			

		
Lighting the fire and melting the ghee, always in the water  
If I hear the sacred verse of bathing in water with delight;  
Fire and water are within you, if you can think and say,  
Will enduring the endless trial be possible!
			
30
			

		
The supreme lord without a mother, the lord of the supreme world  
The lord without a country, the lord of women and men  
Chanting softly together a whispered mantra  
The hunter's whisper is not heard by the pursued.
			
31
			

		
Whisper bag - compact bag  
Darisanam
			
Like the people who, after picking up the dew, add tender coconut water,  
The Lord came and entered my heart’s temple and dwelt there.  
After the Lord came and entered my heart’s temple and dwelt there,  
There is no need for people in this world to open their mouths (to speak) anymore.
			
32
			

		
Level of Knowledge
			
Changing and carrying a human scale on the vehicle   
The fool pours on the soaked stone.  
Even the changing god who knows and sees me  
Placed the guru's path to explain and resolve.
			
33
			

		
Is a temple something special? Are ponds something special?  
Temples and ponds are like family trees to worship!  
Temples are in the heart, ponds are in the heart!  
There is no coming and no going, no, there isn’t.
			
34
			

		
Red sandalwood and black sandalwood, the red caste lingam  
You call him Sivaniruppan in gold and copper  
Know your community after knowing yourself  
The temple-filled Lord will become a dancer and singer!
			
35
			

		
Poosaipoosai, the insects that perform water anointing.  
Where is the place that it anoints on itself that has poosai?  
Did it have adhipoosai, or anadipoosai?  
Did it have edhupoosai? It writhes as if saying this!
			
36
			

		
Even if all the four Vedas exist and the letters are not known,
Though dressed in grand attire and proud, O supreme Lord,
Having a heart of steel and mixed with compassion, only if you can speak the truth,
Will the endless ordeal, without summary, eventually come to an end!
			
37
			

		
If you mixed the water and removed the scum by skimming,  
Whether you skimmed or drank the mixed water,  
Whether you skimmed on the ground or had a long whisker,  
Removing the illusion of the mind, you skimmed within the mind!
			
38
			

		
Is meat something wrong? Is money something wrong?  
Even meat and bones have marks, right?  
Is meat-eating different, or is money different?  
You who differentiate between meat and money within yourself!
			
39
			

		
You call the water drunk through the mouth phlegm;  
Will the throat sprout and become swollen?  
You drink water through the mouth to clear the phlegm  
When the throat has cleared, stand up and speak!
			
40
			

		
In the reading Veda there is Eshil.,  
In the inner mantras there is Eshil;  
In the teachings there is Eshil.,  
In the worlds there is Eshil;  
In the mystical powers there is Eshil.,  
In wisdom there is Eshil, in light there is Eshil;  
In this there is none, none at all, none none none!
			
41
			

		
Before birth, where does one exist, O Tengan?  
After birth and returning to the earth, where does one remain, O Tengan?  
People who do not speak clearly are like unclear marks.  
The edge of the tongue and ears are like a double-edged sword.
			
42
			

		
If the pillar is shaken with a bow, will it tremble?  
If the boundless rocky sea is stirred, will it be disturbed?  
Will darkness come near a yogi without bliss?  
Within the golden pillar is the pure Shiva.
			
43
			

		
What is consciousness, what is thought, what is Shiva! Are the sages knowledgeable? Is there caste discrimination in actions? What is liberation? What is the source, what are the fundamental waves? In ignorance is there knowledge, in knowledge there is ignorance; this is what moves.
			
44
			

		
Substrate
			
At the place without doubt, without thinking, without hesitation,  
Without truth, without knowledge, without caste differences,  
Without poison, without origin, the colors of the primordial nectar,  
In the seed containing this knowledge, the one who valued it is Shiva alone.
			
45
			

		
Servitude
			
Is caste really something? Is all the water in the dam  
a single ghost doorway, or are the five elements one?  
In the ear sword, the shore, the wire, and the gold bugle, are they one?  
What is the quality that reads caste discrimination, what kind of quality is that?
			
46
			

		
Level of Knowledge
			
Roasted milk with sprouted rice, churned butter and buttermilk;  
The broken string sound is the body for the souls too;  
The bloomed flower and fallen fruit again become the tree;  
The dead do not come back to life, no no no no.
			
47
			

		
When found in the shelf, it is not called cleanliness of that day,  
Having known the art, is it called that day's purity by bathing,  
Having known the clan, is it called that day's purity by being born of water,  
How can it be associated with a godless deity?
			
48
			

		
The wretched seven-legged cat walks with a limp!
Where has the weakness gone for a weak woman?
Like a turtle, you sink and utter many pains
Weakness has gathered and become word tormentors.
			
49
			

		
When becoming verbal nerves and being the will-fire  
When becoming real nerves and performing the sacred worship  
When becoming true nerves and the scriptures say  
When becoming active nerves, the gathered essence.
			
50
			

	






		
Do you look at the palms and stare at the eyes?  
At which places do you look, counting, counting?  
If you cannot confine the mind that knows falsehood  
It’s likely that you will go beyond truth and hasten to speak within yourself.
			
51
			

		
Leading the goat, drive away the spider like a change  
Showing the cow, will you not confuse me, causing intoxication,  
Showing the spear, the cruel one who killed the elephant,  
Showing the house, you must reveal me.
			
52
			

		
From the left side, the moon; from the right side, the sun  
In the left hand, the discus; in the right hand, the spear is sharp;  
Feet taken, long hair; after counting directions,  
The body blended and stood, who else can see this wonder?
			
53
			

		
Just as salt and saltiness are one and the same,  
The place where the deep Lord and the ruler lived together,  
Here, the six-faced Lord and the moving Chakradhar,  
They speak differently in the fallen, abject hell.
			
54
			

		
Thillainay is his name; Thiruvarang is his name;  
He is the One Pearl of the universe that is boundless.  
He who has many tongues will happily explain;  
The mighty ones will speak, the one who conquers with speech alone.
			
55
			

		
To every direction, to every life, our father is the emperor  
The truthful Vithula sprouts and shines brightly  
When the predetermined, clear Vedas temple is opened  
After seeing all that dance, one sees the dance of restraint.
			
56
			

		
Read the scriptures with deep understanding within you;  
Stand firm and you will attain the ultimate heights;  
Do not harbor enmity towards those who are close,  
Live continually with trials within you as a companion.
			
57
			

		
As soon as it rises adequately and becomes cool,  
As it rushes hurriedly and ripens soothingly,  
Othada, Anjumoonru is one letter,  
Othada nee Ramarama, the name called Rama.
			
58
			

		
Did the letter 'அ' arise from the letter 'அ' itself?  
Did the letter 'உ' arise from the letter 'உ' itself?  
Did 'அ' and 'உ' stand without 'சிகாரம்'?  
Yogis without affections must clarify and explain.
			
59
			

		
You are the virtue for virtues, you are the direction for the world,  
You are the talent for talents, you are the sought-after thought,  
You are sleep, you are perception, you are the inner suffering mingled within,  
Do not forget the unforgettable bitter gall, even if you try to.
			
60
			

		
You are the infinite, you are the immeasurable, the primordial deer,  
You are the seen, you are the understood, you are the epic poems,  
The virtuous who realize beyond the pondarika,  
What is steadfastness, what is sharpness, is indeed sharpness.
			
61
			

		
The one with tightly closed eyes, in the realm of sleep that causes dizziness,  
It is not possible for you to swim across and remain there.  
If you achieve enlightened wisdom through a truly understanding mind,  
Knowing life, you will live a golden era.
			
62
			

		
The crops swaying by the gateway with the bud  
If you can truly listen to the words spoken by the teacher  
The fruit-bearing plants standing erect will become ripe and full  
And the sacred fruit-bearing plants will mature well together!
			
63
			

		
The poor seek to have the sacred waters to bathe,  
Where can the sacred waters flow clearly?  
After the sacred waters flow clearly within you,  
What is sacred will flourish in Shiva's grace!
			
64
			

		
Raise your neck and open your good eyes  
What sin is it to have fallen with an aged mouth?  
To be orphaned amidst heavy fate  
May it be in the form of letters or not, it could exist nonetheless.
			
65
			

		
The illusion that stopped and the ghost that stood beside,  
The shifting water of food and sleep that you can perceive,  
Becoming pure, fearing that nothing is permanent in the ancient world,  
You are the cosmic particle, the primordial root, the source itself!
			
66
			

		
Those who descend from Eendravasa and count their strengths will achieve greatness!  
Know the reason why the banana tree does not wither.  
If you can open the five senses and look at the land,  
Illusions will vanish after testing, and the truth will emerge.
			
67
			

		
Do the bees with pollen on their faces dance with the wind?  
Do you open your mouth and count the true beads?  
After opening your mouth and realizing the true water,  
The truth inside the bee is indeed a mystic.
			
68
			

		
The test that sprouted at the root itself  
After being within you for four quarters of a day  
Can live as a child and can become the universe;  
There is the world, the seen command, the mother command, the truth.
			
69
			

		
When it is said that one must exist, will it remain as existence?  
When it is said that one must die, was it created by the earth?  
The profound word spoken by the noble one without abbreviation  
Before dying, bow down as medicine, do not lose your status.
			
70
			

		
Are there not eighty-one letters contained?  
Is the mantra that pervades the sky not the unity of the four Vedas?  
The primal five letters from which the sky pervades sprouted  
Have taken the form of the Lingam and seated as Siva.
			
71
			

		
The letter 'Sivaya' is the letter where Shiva resides  
The true letter to believe as a method is  
The air that passes through a flawless door  
Is called the method, and it is also the letter 'Sivaya' with the anusvara diacritic.
			
72
			

		
Not form, not appearance, not standing above one  
Not transformation, not the door, not belonging, not other, not lacking  
Not big, not small, even speech is not that alone  
Who can see the rarity when steadfastness stands?
			
73
			

		
Is the soul without origin? Is the orphan without origin?  
Are the blossomed five elements without origin?  
Are the logical texts and Sadasiva without origin?  
The awakened yogis? Must speak quickly!
			
74
			

		
Those who are ignorant read scriptures;  
Those who are bewildered by the path do not know truth;  
In the stomach, there is curd, but it enters the village in search of butter—  
How can one associate with ignorant people?
			
75
			

		
Love state
			
Both the stages do not fully match, do not look with heat;  
Do not regard as one the truth that stands as the third stage;  
After imagination turns into the black stage,  
You can be clear that it is called the divine stage!
			
76
			

		
You stand in love yearning in the womb
The poor souls who tremble and fall
By constant correction, the unjust red letter
Will melt and destroy you, you will realize and understand.
			
77
			

		
It is unusual to be born on earth and to speak,
The incalculable million gods, what is yours and what is mine,
Like the jewel hidden in the eye from sight,
Millions of gods, because of this eye, are awake.
			
78
			

		
State of Knowledge
			
When the clay pot falls, he will set it down and stack it up  
When the bronze pot falls, he will make a sound calling for a stick;  
When our pot falls, he will scold and punish  
When the count is lost and everything stands still, what is this, O God?
			
79
			

		
Riches are like the wings created by the serpent kings,  
If you cling tightly to the wings, you will know how they burn.  
People see these as illusions called surroundings,  
When death calls, will they come together as a flock?
			
80
			

		
Metal - Shape
			
With the full moon month vibrant, O beauty  
Becoming one, becoming two, in the youthful town  
Wearing a creeper garland nearby, they dance in the hall  
Reading shy letters, many sins will fade away.
			
81
			

		
Wealth grows like grains of rice, and wives and children bring happiness  
On the day the elephant keeper lives in the courtyard  
Running to meet the messenger of time, clashing fiercely  
Lying down, life drained, you fail to realize the truth you see!
			
82
			

		
Among the clouds that sing, You are the dancing feet  
Our Lord who placed the unbroken collection of deeds  
Father who danced in the temple of shining bronze,  
Blue-throated, time-destroying, eternal rider.
			
83
			

		
In the barren wilderness, like a standing tree,  
In the heart without wisdom, there is nothing good;  
If one restrains feelings joined with endless trials,  
Like the honey's fermentation inside, purity is Shiva alone.
			
84
			

		
Drink it up inside you, the external heat that has flown in  
If you think of it, your mind will become calm.  
Melt and run everywhere, the fire within you  
You will understand that it is for your own good.
			
85
			

		
Having been purified through trials and strengthened,  
The completely enlightened one who expounds the unteachable doctrine,  
Coming running through the streets and penetrating the sky,  
The primordial lord has existed eternally as his own lord.
			
86
			

		
It is not bravery to rise by God’s will, but by strength;  
It is by wisdom that wounds are healed, and by fear that peace is established.  
The nine gates that were worn out and disappeared, O Lord of birth,  
Have become one, and within that one are seated a hundred million souls.
			
87
			

		
From within the heart, the rushing breath  
Can be calmed only by love, O mighty one,  
In the temple of love, can be seen spreading in all directions,  
Darting swiftly and telling, O Swami!
			
88
			

		
The wind that bowed down to Delhi,  
The solitary magical hand that crossed the boundary,  
Beyond the boundary, outside the heavenly world,  
Turned white and red and stood blended in reality.
			
89
			

		
Did the body take life, or did life take the body?  
When body takes life, what is the form, tell me.  
When the body and life die, life does not perish.  
The body’s truth being forgotten, realizing and understanding, the wisdom flows.
			
90
			

		
By the letter 'அ', you created the infinite seven;  
By the letter 'உ', you stood firm;  
By the letter 'ம', the world became enchanted;  
Sitting as அ, உ, and ம, that is Shiva alone!
			
91
			

		
Mantras exist, O bewildered mankind!  
Mantras arise and permeate the unconscious;  
Mantras are the breath that awakens religion;  
Those who possess the mantra have no death!
			
92
			

		
What can I say, grammar lessens not?  
The ancient Tamil's greatness surpasses virtue  
Like lightning flashing and flickering in the sky  
Neither God nor elephant exists within me!
			
93
			

		
Like a different banyan tree with a bent banyan root in the grove,  
Today itself bear fruit differently and proceed to attain success!  
Do not separate from the six different kinds, O ignorant people!  
The greatness you see lies spread within you!
			
94
			

		
The Avudhit mantra as 'A' and 'U'  
For those who know any letter, is it the seventy births here?  
If one holds the Avudhit mantra firmly,  
Sitting as 'A' and 'U', that alone is Shiva.
			
95
			

		
Interest - Rotary Shaft Donation
			
Eighty-nine as the feet, ninety as the stomach,  
Seventy-two as the shoulders, the best as the speech,  
Seventy-two as the eyes, in the honesty that stood weeping,  
With balanced speech stood steadfast, Sivaya’s splendor indeed.
			
96
			

		
Two and one as the base, within the driving wheel  
Three rolled and twisted, like a spinning top you lay  
The sound of the conch shell rises and falls, penetrating the core pulse  
In the city of Arangan, it rests – that is Shiva alone!
			
97
			

		
A turtle swimming in the sea climbs the shore and lays eggs  
When swimming in the sea, like a beautiful crab  
Inside the chariot of the sea, our Maniyaranga friend  
The true reality is what is thought within the body, indeed the truth!
			
98
			

		
Three-braided Lathin and the upright pillar,  
In the mouth of the four snakes, the radiant letter;  
The mantra taken and told by both mother and father;  
In one letter that appears, there is nothing untold anywhere!
			
99
			

		
Three threes, all are sought by the three gods  
Within those three five letters that resound clearly  
The husband and the lord who governs alike  
In the manifested realm, there is nowhere to speak!
			
100
			

	






		
Like a ghost who is eating, like a corpse lying still water  
O blind one who rose in the dancing group,  
You who are capable of cracking the five,  
Among the sixty million Vēṇiyars, you are one in six!
			
101
			

		
The divine light within you, swirling like a circle  
In the palm of your hand, restraint and suppression  
Moving step by step in the wheel  
We can ascend after knowing the ego.
			
102
			

		
The speaker and the Lord, supreme knowledge is within you;  
The five elements who desire wander and tremble;  
If the five elements who desire are controlled within the body,  
They do not speak, the Lord comes and speaks.
			
103
			

		
Namasthe Sivaya, may the five letters and the higher realms  
Namasthe Sivaya, the fivefold ancient illusion  
Namasthe Sivaya, may the five letters reside within us!  
Namasthe Sivaya, O lord, speak the truth well!
			
104
			

		
The Supreme Being is mine; I have no other fear, oh Protector!  
Even if you take and stand holding a bow and arrow, god who shoots!  
The Lord who melts hardship and offers nectar on his chest;  
The sacred speech you gave me, the Om Namashi word!
			
105
			

		
The hunter who tastes the green soil with rotten teeth  
Will surely become as he imagines;  
The hummingbird that pierced and flew through the green soil  
Oh beggars, understand, this is nature’s true art.
			
106
			

		
On the shining Kasi, all devotees come to stay  
On the shining Sodhimeni Visvanatha, I am one  
Along with the clear Mangai, the lamp that speaks  
Is the simple Rama Rama, the name of Ramamirtha.
			
107
			

		
With eyes adorned by the blossomed bow and arrow,
There is no fruit born that can sprout outside.
The expansive land and the deep-rooted knowledge,
The enlightened sages remain steadfast in clarity.
			
108
			

		
Om Namasi mouth, after realizing the truth  
Om Namasi mouth, after clearly understanding the truth  
Om Namasi mouth, after realizing the truth  
Om Namasi mouth will remain united!
			
109
			

		
Allalvasal is nine and is the gate of meaning,
Sollumvasal is five and stands firm like Sommi,
Nallavasal opens easily and passes through Gnanavasal,
Those who see Ellaivasal know there is no sweeter birth.
			
110
			

		
The primordial one is not just one but many forms  
After arising as the differentiated illusion and becoming the universal Lord  
Even after being with the primordial, awakening again as the pure consciousness  
He is the tested knower and remains pure.
			
111
			

		
The world blossomed essentially because it bloomed,  
The blossomed flower’s fragrance came, touched, and released,  
The five senses were confused and fell upon the earth,  
When they swayed and stood, what is this illusion, O Lord?
			
112
			

		
Having a pair of eyes and a vast sky,  
The ray of light that stands united at one place today,  
The inside and outside that exists in every atom today,  
The one who saw the patterns, knowing Shiva—the wise one!
			
113
			

		
Climbing the mountain ridge and then retreating again,  
You say impossible tasks will be accomplished,  
How is it possible to live together with a man who does not bow his head to the noble daily on the ground?
			
114
			

		
When the tongue-tied language perishes, when the noble clan perishes,  
When the ritual priest perishes and the inquiry diminishes,  
What is this, O sinners? When Vamanadu becomes a wasteland,  
On the day Auviyar ceases, all five will cease as well.
			
115
			

		
No, no, the poor who waver saying no,  
Can what once stood firm as no become yes?  
No is not one, not none, nor two;  
When knowing all, one does not give birth to sweetness.
			
116
			

		
Kara Kara Kara Kara Kavalozhi Kavalan  
Pora Pora Pora Pora Porilnindra Punniyan  
Maara Maara Maara Maara Marangal Ezhuum Eythasee  
Raamaraama Raamaraama Raamaennum Naamame.
			
117
			

		
The patient one is born, the timely Kaayanthan  
When wandering around the house, do you wish for pleasure?  
Have the four Vedas spread in this world?  
O Lord Rama, the one who is known as Ramaraama, what is our name!
			
118
			

		
By the goodness of life, the body is taken and kept!  
When the life-body perishes, forms after forms vanish  
Becoming the illusion of life-energy, one destroys another  
Becoming the illusion of life-substance, one consumes another.
			
119
			

		
The net letters are circles filled with strength, O feminine force,  
I have not seen a single circle in the net letters;  
If it is focused in the defected letters, the combed foot marks it,  
In the net letters, the circle is not straight, O our lord!
			
120
			

		
The true essence unknown to the gods in the sky  
Tembran who stood firm with unwavering eyes  
After being born on earth and setting fragrant blossoms  
The great ones too reside within us; this is true life.
			
121
			

		
Beyond the sky stood the radiant western light opened,  
After merging within the eyes and mixing inside,  
The illusion born of earth and the dizziness forgotten,  
To be united with the all-knowing God is the truth.
			
122
			

		
After knowing the true breath in the original breath  
Day by day becoming a steadfast land in the country  
Growing as a child, it can persist, it can be vast and immense  
There is a rule seen in the universe, a great rule, it is the truth!
			
123
			

		
Like lightning rising, lightning flashing, lightning darting away in various forms,  
The one within me, the one in my being, does indeed reside there,  
Because of not knowing the exact measure of the distance seen by the eyes before the eyes,  
Without the light within me, I have known nothing!
			
124
			

		
It could be, it might be, it could be in him,  
Brahman with the firewood can remove the seven universes.  
In an ungraspable pit, on a legless pillar,  
After opening the furnace, you and I are both the Lord!
			
125
			

		
Unity and diversity both become one,  
How can separation and union coexist?  
Expansion and dissolution are its essence,  
Death and birth do not exist, no, no!
			
126
			

		
In the Vedas, everything arises as elements; there, with the water as base,  
If one worships by applying the lingam on the feet,  
The wise ones who have pierced the ear and opened the door,  
O revered one, crossing that primordial ocean, reach the rare abode!
			
127
			

		
Cotton thread twisted and frayed, oh people waving shawls!  
The corrected thread twisted can only remove suffering,  
If you master the thread of thought, the thread of time will disappear,  
Correcting the thread is worrying, Shiva and the five letters alone.
			
128
			

		
Beware, those who perform the philosophical rites,  
Are they gods as well? Shall I act without laughing?  
Among three, the first fool with three eyes, unknown to the others,  
Guarded within you, may he be seen entwined.
			
129
			

		
Those blind ones who immerse in water morning and evening  
The bed called 'thēr' that lies in the water morning and evening  
If the limb (time) rises and perceives with one of the three eyes  
If the root is contemplated, it becomes the pearl and wisdom.
			
130
			

		
Is our god and your god two different gods?  
Are there two illusions there and here?  
Is there not one primordial form who exists there and here?  
Those who speak in false words are liars and cheats.
			
131
			

		
You call the state of confusion as ignorance;  
You call ignorance that exists since birth as ignorance;  
You call it ignorance if one bathes after knowing the method;  
How can it agree with a vile person without patience?
			
132
			

		
As soon as the noise came from outside,
O mute one who twists and drowns in the water!
What is purity? What is bondage? What stands as purity?
What has the virus looked upon? What is the difference, O wise one?
			
133
			

		
Every month is just dust, forgotten dust  
On the monthless night, a form has grown?  
What is the sound, what is the Veda, what are good lineages for?  
Do the Vedas recite as the priests utter?
			
134
			

		
Has the pride stopped because of the darkness?  
Has the masculinity stopped because of the habit?  
The era free from disturbances of stubbornness and masculinity  
Is said to be the time free from pride and standing still!
			
135
			

		
The stagnant dirt that has soaked, the frozen fool who stands still,  
What is the use of talking differently and claiming to be born anew?  
Is not the washing away of dirt the way good families are born?  
The fool who is torn apart is indeed the form that stands with that dirt.
			
136
			

		
The land where even a woman, standing with malice in her heart, is soaked through,  
Where the entire world has seen men and women living together as one.  
The land where Shiva, who remained detached from desires,  
Is brought down by lust — what land is this land?
			
137
			

		
Do you endlessly search for what you must have?  
Even if you search for what you want, it is neither present nor absent,  
After renouncing the desire to seek what you want,  
The meaning of "must have" will naturally unveil itself!
			
138
			

		
The Vedas and Shastras are excellent blessings,  
Dramas and truthful books on philosophy,  
When compiled, tales emerge from all the iron in the heart,  
After understanding, it all ends like a spent pot!
			
139
			

		
Hundred crore scriptures, hundred crore mantras  
If chanted for a hundred crore days, what is the benefit?  
Every six, every six, as an inner letter  
If you chant the six-letter word, God will come and speak!
			
140
			

		
Kalanar who mingled within himself morning and evening  
What is this magic that came begging morning and evening, tell me?  
If you turn away from the thought of morning and evening water  
There is no Kalanar standing morning and evening, there is none.
			
141
			

		
Within the eight districts, two districts bend,  
Within the sixteen districts, counting six districts,  
Within the thirty districts, three districts appear,  
Within the sixty districts stood Nadanadi!
			
142
			

		
In which of the forty-two regions did the Lord stand?  
The fierce one stood where the twelve primal channels are found;  
Among the thirty-six strands the eight directions are united,  
Among the twenty-four strands they mingle and flow, there He stood.
			
143
			

		
Mother and father are the taste of saltwater, know this well;  
Mother and father are the taste of saltwater, the worthy one;  
Mother and father are the taste of saltwater from the beginning and the end;  
Without mother and father, no one exists.
			
144
			

		
How did the body get involved before clarification?  
What are the reasons before clarification?  
How does the time set for matching align?  
One must understand the emphasized word!
			
145
			

		
There is a beginning but no end; on that day there is no Veda.  
There is a cause but it does not speak; in the inevitable sanction;  
Among the first three seated is the ether,  
On that primal day, who knows even itself, O Lord?
			
146
			

		
By lyrical excellence, by lyrical excellence, why do you speak of distinctions?  
How was Embran separated from the lyric?  
The grand festival shudders as if by the lyric,  
The madman, who sprouted and rose within the lyric, is indeed all that!
			
147
			

		
After the spilled milk grew into a water pot  
What once was one became two, what could it be?  
What was separated by the mango leaf, what is that?  
What grew into the moon is a gray cloud?
			
148
			

		
You recklessly throw the whetstone called Undakkallai as a taunt;  
Is the whetstone you saw any different for the Lord?  
Listen, the seen whetstone, with its polished surface only,  
What purity does it have? Fool who has no insight!
			
149
			

		
Books that were read and studied, and the learning gained  
The eternal sleep that people around have forgotten  
Did they accept or did it remain everywhere standing?  
Tell me truly, O Swami, who accepted the test!
			
150
			

		
Like the bells tied around the bull’s neck,  
Bound in three or four locks until the end,  
The three or four worlds and the endless forms,  
What is the truth that is wholly soaked in truth?
			
151
			

		
Like a mother crow and her young one,  
They quarrel in the crow’s gathering!  
After the hornbill entered the jackal's group,  
Both the crow and the young one died!
			
152
			

		
The thorns that sprouted in the original pond  
Time stood up and at the crossroads in the four directions  
Can live as a child, can become the vast universe;  
There is desire, the seen path, the mother's path is the truth!
			
153
			

		
Like the Citharas with bronze strings in the bronze festival,  
The testing hall where the bow cannot write,  
The copper, coppered copper, gently blending,  
In bronze with bronze strings, the message is seen!
			
154
			

		
Team Arena - Beautiful Skirmish
			
From nation to nation, within us all, there are those who can truly see,  
Running and running, he will return, he will settle within you.  
The era that came searching will stand frightened and leave,  
Countless eras will exist without diminishing!
			
155
			

		
Why do you suffer, fool with lost wisdom?  
The great light that does not suffer recognizes the soul.  
The one who suffers is not capable of avoiding the twofold suffering!  
One can only obtain great joy by not suffering!
			
156
			

		
Fishermen have not eaten meat, even then and now, wise men?  
Fish live in water or diving and drinking it  
Hunters have not eaten meat, even then and now, wise men,  
Is it the skin piercings or wearing chest threads.
			
157
			

		
The priests neither ate goat meat then nor now  
Isn't goat meat a sacrificial offering you perform?  
The priests neither ate cow meat then nor now  
Isn't cow meat just like vegetable curry?
			
158
			

		
There, standing as the origin of all life,  
Here, holding Uma, acclaimed and blessed,  
There, born and nurtured, passing through years,  
There, the truth I have made you realize.
			
159
			

		
How did the lord come and enter the true world?  
Like how the young bud absorbs water.  
After the lord came and entered the true world and took the temple,  
Is there no one in the world who will talk with the humans!
			
160
			

		
Crossing countless ages, above the land of the world,  
The finest teaching of humility and knowledge,  
Filled with every virtue, steady and supreme,  
Those who understand this form are divine beings, O God.
			
161
			

		
Is the letter without a beginning? Is the soul without a beginning?  
Is the spirit residing in the body and the senses without a beginning?  
Are the logic books and scriptures without a beginning?  
Is the true guru who revealed the present desire without a beginning?
			
162
			

		
What have you seen? If you keep looking, your eyesight will dwindle  
If you stay strong, your nature will be like pure Shiva;  
The more you see, your eyesight will fade away  
You will blend in as blooming flowers withering—O born one.
			
163
			

		
The blue lamp that flickers over the forehead  
He held onto it for ten moments while standing still  
It did not behold, a light above the inner light  
That one who sat there, the pure one is the orphan.
			
164
			

		
Taking water, putting it into water, a water-like deed  
You consume half, do you confine all the water in that?  
You consume the root, the seed shoots forth from the seed  
You are the expert in order, the abode of Shiva's feet can be joined!
			
165
			

		
			
			Do not hesitate to lift the blue lamp on the forehead and look,  
			The one who continued the inner trials in the tenth, that is the supreme truth.  
			Those who were at the threshold, to me, are my Lord.
			
166
			

		
Before thought, where was the wound?  
Before speech, where was the breath?  
Before grace was given, where was the desire?  
You say that what was firmly held was Shiva alone.
			
167
			

		
Before the intellect, there was injury in the deity,  
Before the logic, there was injury in the deity  
Before granting grace, there was desire in the air  
You say that what is contemplated is Shiva.
			
168
			

		
Thirukku - Doubt
			
The barren grandmother and the sage on the head,  
The act done by the birds pecking the hut,  
When the wise man who goes on the street threw stones,  
The sinners indeed suffered greatly, only for Shiva.
			
169
			

		
When a barefoot ran and cut his foot,  
When a sinful cat came and jumped into the milk,  
When the servant came and saw, saying there is no trouble,  
When the string snapped, what is this magic, O Lord?
			
170
			

		
Four squares vanish, eight remain; three indeed subside,  
Like the opposing wind, the circle dwells.  
The eight lines that fall, I count on my head,  
O Lord, who rose mingled with the fiery field of the sun.
			
171
			

		
After adding four and three to the ten above,  
With the change of sixteen, and after two and three more,  
In the abundance of the pattern, the master said,  
The voice appeared as the lord on the surface like skin.
			
172
			

		
As soon as it rises fiercely, as soon as the snipe stands,  
As soon as it is born for the country, it is the powerful Shiva's detail,  
Lord wears numerous mantras for drinking,  
The fifty letters stand filled with intention.
			
173
			

		
As an Angalinga seat, in the twelve letters  
Overflowing, they fit even in the inner shell  
The tested share and the broad five letters  
The sound of Singanatha and Sivaayam or is there none.
			
174
			

		
Where is the form within the great light without comparison?  
Where is the form that stood like a comparison in the universe?  
Where did the supreme being, having performed penance, stand?  
Where did the support born in the present moment stand and dwell?
			
175
			

		
Where did the three calves die together?
Tell me, where is the lower world standing still?
Because of their union, Arunjeevan was born,
She is Meru itself, where is that place?
			
176
			

		
Where does it sprout? Where does it withdraw?  
Where does it break? Where is the tear?  
Where does it stand firm? Where is the dizziness?  
Wise ones who can decide, need to explain in detail.
			
177
			

		
Returning gate eight, skillful gate eight,  
Unfading kolam eight, Vanniyadu gate eight,  
Unscarred kolam eight, wandering marular!  
There is an inexhaustible flower, Aiyan's order is the truth!
			
178
			

		
From self, the root letter turned off, purified by breath  
From honey, the room opened, the first lunar day coincided  
From sky, at three in the afternoon, after the staff entered  
From needle, measured, O good Yogi among Yogis!
			
179
			

		
When I thought of as a pearl, on the coarse sand of the past year
Ten men and the mother danced the Parindu dance,
Sages who became Siddhars, those who dance the Thillai dance!
When they saw that dance, they focused on the Adangala dance.
			
180
			

		
One is one, all the world is one  
Yesterday and today are one, the beginningless is one  
If the land is bent like a red hill covered with a net  
That God within you, recognized, is Shiva alone.
			
181
			

		
Did the auspicious Vedic hymns and the Vedas that perished
The combined scripture and the four Vedas harmonized by Omagundam
The book that was compiled and harshly treated for this disaster
It ended broken, only the Brahmin would know.
			
182
			

		
The tamarind tree that grew tall in the circular courtyard  
Like conch shells in rows of ten by the rule  
Left behind, locked at the entrance door by a bolt  
How could Shiva, who rose in the egg, leave like that?
			
183
			

		
What is a temple school? What is it dedicated to?  
Are the mantras recited by mouth dedicated?  
If one worships beneficially in a wise school  
One can see God in a sacred school.
			
184
			

		
Good silver as six things, shining red copper as four things,  
Kollunaagam as three things, clan-red bronze as two things,  
With the sound of a bow as one, O brave one who can blow with skill,  
You will cross the boundary of trials without failing.
			
185
			

		
Pure-minded silent sages;  
Even if they are in the forest, their minds remain pure;  
Silent sages with impure minds  
Though they are in bondage, they endure rebirth!
			
186
			

		
It is neither form nor light, yet it stands as one  
It is neither matter nor energy, nor the subtle flow sensed  
It is neither great nor small, not even the speaking breeze  
It is rare and true, none can see it.
			
187
			

		
One letter has risen all over the world in a single stroke  
Two letters move, do not know this bliss  
Three letters together depict the triad  
The four letters danced on the tongue are for Shiva.
			
188
			

		
From the primal source, the primordial sound is the five elements  
From the primal source, the primordial sound awakens  
From the primal source, the primordial sound stands supreme  
From the primal source, the primordial sound is Shiva itself.
			
189
			

		
All those born to Annam can live for many crores of years  
All those born to Sornam can do many evil deeds  
All those born to Vinnam will fall in hell  
All those born to Kannam passing beyond it is the ultimate peace!
			
190
			

		
Water standing without moving is water without sleep.  
Water without differentiation is water standing without clarity.  
Water standing with knowledge without desire is understood clearly.  
How can water standing without anything act?
			
191
			

		
When born, the spear and the Lankan thread are tied;  
Is it born along with the birth, or can the tying thread be loosened?  
Have the four Vedas awakened within the mind?  
What is the power that stood open in the sky, having spread like the earth?
			
192
			

		
There are flaws and faults, trials as precious as gold,  
If corrected, the mind will rise and prevail,  
Like a majestic pillar, it will spread across Lanka,  
The firm test and you, are not separate.
			
193
			

		
Like a dazzling lamp flashing brightly  
Will you act like those who boast and show off  
Spreading extensively like red gold found everywhere  
What kind of filthy worship is this worship?
			
194
			

		
The one who sprouted from the hard, dusty seed,  
The brave one who stood holding and looked around,  
The lord who stood in the cradle, piercing and burning,  
With the helping hand, the home will be there.
			
195
			

		
Arukkan and Soman, and beyond that too  
The sincerity standing close to Thaarakai  
Melting, a letter unmatched outside  
Could there be a great pain sweeter to be born?
			
196
			

		
Arukkan - Sun, Soman - Moon
			
On the original circle sprouted five letters  
On the geometric circle, three merged and bent to stand  
On the palm leaf circle blossomed knowledge unending  
The curved circle remained as Shiva alone.
			
197
			

		
In the western direction of Scorpio, at the gateway of the constellation
At the jewel letter eight, in the root chakra
Fearless syllable, as the wise and the eternal one
The mantra pronounced is truth and is Shiva.
			
198
			

		
Flowers and water blend with my heart, temple and my soul  
Vaporizing, becoming a lingam, infinite everywhere  
The five elements that exist shine like a sacred lamp  
There is no dusk for the dancer performing the dance.
			
199
			

		
After the melting turmoil, you and I realized each other  
Whether in presence or absence, I used to think  
When we melted and stood together, were you and I one?  
When we got separated, it became clear that it was Shiva alone.
			
200
			

	






		
Sivayam clarified in five letters can destroy mountains  
Sivayam clarified in five letters can rule the sky  
Sivayam clarified in five letters, the heavenly substance  
Sivayam clarified in five letters is the truth that is realized.
			
201
			

		
Like a wave shaking and rolling in a deceptive pond  
This desire and sensory perception drift over the water  
Like a frog sitting on the muddy surface of a pond  
This desire, having Shiva, remains settled and suitable.
			
202
			

		
The clever thief who flew like a kite
You must catch him with smartness;
Don't plan or hesitate, don't leave him,
Be firm and catch the thief who slyly stole.
			
203
			

		
Like the sun setting and the daylight fading, the internal greatness has died away  
Crossing all worlds and universe in many forms  
The eternal truth of happiness and the form of bliss born in word and heart  
Is spoken by me, none else as a companion exists, I am the One.
			
204
			

		
The cloud that stayed as twelve Mondays;  
two hands, two legs, two eyes are also there  
the real two shining as the sound of fire, the Tamil God of war  
The pure body itself tells about the cloud.
			
205
			

		
The Lingam pedestal and the three syllables of Asavai  
In the conch shell hand and in all the skies  
Even if the yogis who participated and feared the supreme gate  
The roar of the Lion Lord and Shiva are not to be doubted.
			
206
			

		
Asavai - Asupa Mantra
			
Those who speak of the five-letter and three-letter words of love  
The five-letter and three-letter words do not refer to that meaning;  
Once the five-letter and heart-written words are understood,  
The five-letter word becomes like that fire, which is Shiva Himself.
			
207
			

		
The chanted mantra settled and brought auspiciousness  
The maternal daughters' gathering and the sleepy slumber  
Did it take refuge somewhere, or did it stand everywhere?  
Tell me, O Swami, where did it take shelter like a lamp?
			
208
			

		
Is the letter eternal, or is the soul eternal?  
Are the spirits and senses that exist eternal?  
Are the apt scriptures and Sadasiva eternal?  
Great yogis, you must speak quickly.
			
209
			

		
The ninth entrance is the day of death  
The ninth is the name Ramaram Rama  
Disease comes with the words of violent people  
It is to be immersed in the words of loving people.
			
210
			

		
Why did you pour the cold water? What was stirred in the breast?  
Slowly, the ignorant ones murmur, whispering softly  
Why did you deceive and close your eyes?  
Slowly, birds of prey, announce, announce.
			
211
			

		
The sorrow that descended in the dust of motherly affection  
Melts away ahead like a drop of dew;  
Your tears too settle in a dusty heart  
Only after are born those who see the dust.
			
212
			

		
Those who bathe in filth yet remain untainted,  
Where is the place that is filthy, where is the place that is unbeautiful.  
If you cannot clean the place where it is filthy,  
You will live approaching the pure with doubt.
			
213
			

		
Like a close wave, like all schools of fish,  
Born of the mind, you are drifting in the thread, feeling dizzy.  
What is falling; what is dying; passing through grief,  
What is thinking? What is standing? Think and watch.
			
214
			

		
Before the primordial, beyond the intermediate,
Testing, stands the shaman Surudhinatha Soma,
Unaware, the wise ones who realized within themselves,
Is there even the slightest thing called discrimination!
			
215
			

		
There is no barrier in the battlefield of primordial times  
Folding the tongue within, reaching the nerve canal  
Gathering the sting and tightening the pressure, O mighty one  
Seeing and seeing repeatedly, everything becomes Parabrahman.
			
216
			

		
Fear, fear, fear, fear, not doing anything,
Fear, fear, fear is sitting inside in peace,
Fear, fear, fear cannot be endured,
Fear, fear, sitting inside you is Shiva itself.
			
217
			

		
Why did you sit and stand like a silent letter?  
Why did you stand and speak like a heart letter?  
What is the use of cutting with the sword of a silent letter?  
The honesty of a sprout letter must be explained clearly.
			
218
			

		
Where was the life? The nature of the body?
Is there any life? Is there any body?
Is there anything that unites life and body?
The wise who created the body through life, tell me.
			
219
			

		
The spinning letters and the face of words remain  
Pain and pleasure pass beyond the senses  
Raising the intense letter within  
Six limbs mingle, beyond the next place.
			
220
			

		
Before refining, the vital sound arises
Before expressing thoughts, what is the hurt, what is the loss
Before granting grace, without the root of knowledge, what is the gift
Know this well, O flawed teachers whose qualities are ruined.
			
221
			

		
The lord who resides everywhere, after entering us first  
He shares parts, approaches with songs  
Is there a difference between our god and your god?  
Your difference is the truth of that day, two are not there, right?
			
222
			

		
Rarely and widely spread everywhere as one  
Growing large, is there not one path standing in the world?  
The foolish who pretended differently to expand,  
With knowledge, here and there, it is one and the same.
			
223
			

		
You measure the length of the wind and act accordingly  
The daily spell is what the mind thinks  
Is it the primordial mantra or the original mantra in the blood,  
Which mantra in the blood will bring the Lord to act?
			
224
			

		
In the letter 'அ' many forms appear  
In the letter 'உ' they stand erect  
In the letter 'ம' the world is dizzy  
In the letter 'ச' that which is clear is Shiva alone.
			
225
			

		
Did the letter "U" come to the letter "A" and become "Sa"?
Did the letter "U" and the letter "Ma" stand one upon the other?
Even if the sharp consonants stand together, even if Shiva's steps unite,
The full knowledge-bearers must explain elaborately.
			
226
			

		
Miwwai - Good Quality
			
In the primal five and the orphaned four,  
In the trialed three and the formless two,  
The virtue filled only in the just seven,  
The primal seven alone is the root and the richness.
			
227
			

		
			
			There is nothing without a sky, there is no sky without space
			There is nothing without a deficiency, there is no deficiency without a lack
			There is nothing without a self, there is no self without the soul
			There is nothing without a foundation, it is the hesitation that performs!
			
228
			

		
The spinning letter tells you to stay face to face  
Crossing pain and pleasure, the country speaks, going somewhere  
Raising the flag of strong anger  
Crossing six rivers of Yamuna, then outside beyond.
			
229
			

		
When the cataracts gathered, letters stopped  
Outside the Indra palace where crops had grown  
Pressing down, feeling dizzy and experiencing  
He existed, I did not, no one existed, it was solitude.
			
230
			

		
Good qualities in people are sought after, traveling from country to country.  
Good qualities in people exist, the Lord exists within us.  
If we seek qualities of the mind and worship only one deity,  
Even the highest Lord Shiva will dance within the abode of Shiva's feet.
			
231
			

		
Before the body that stands within the life form perishes,  
The body form will become the life form, the form of the body will become.  
To unite life and body is fear,  
I spoke as if the body was taken by life.
			
232
			

		
The eternal Anthony who toils throughout the universe, toils still  
Standing vast with Pandaimal and Ayan, toils still  
Crossing the cardinal directions, the dark sound toils still  
The universe will dance as one, the primal dance will be performed.
			
233
			

		
The purified water, possessing its element, shapes and maintains itself  
Will the great path speak, the blind like a demon,  
The black Yamalam, as a Lord who cannot be seen,  
Rightfully within you, one must realize and understand.
			
234
			

		
The carved stone and the ancient object, you call it water  
The poor who have no thoughts, you speak about them by name  
To do, to create, to make and to give  
All become one, and I consume the one that spreads across the world in my heart.
			
235
			

		
All the four Vedas and the Navinsavindhu together as one,  
Sit merged in the midst of the infinite, in varied forms.  
The elemental creation speaks the mantra,  
The supreme sages must widely expound it.
			
236
			

		
When it was a waterfall, Mother was not known there  
When it took form, I came to know you  
The guru, understanding clearly, became the unshakable wisdom  
When it was appropriate, the vast universe was created.
			
237
			

		
Birth and death, existence without birth,  
Forgetting and thinking, clarity of what is hidden,  
Renunciation and giving, enjoying and eating,  
Birth and death, the birth home will contain all.
			
238
			

		
Those present in the eyes are from the dark ocean's bite  
Those present in the sky are the ones who stand above  
Those present within are the creator of the earth  
Those present within me are standing everywhere.
			
239
			

		
Whether you search the land of goats or the army of elephants  
Whether you search Kodivasai, will it stand crosswise and wait?  
The begging that was given and the righteousness done for favor  
Like a horse that has been ridiculed, righteousness will come and stand.
			
240
			

		
Iron blanket, cotton cloth, bronze,  
The Lord who wears these as garments,  
Is a fitting gift to the priests present,  
O Shiva, who gently comes and cures all diseases.
			
241
			

		
The people in the village come together as one  
You drag the chariot pulling the bow and arrow  
Even if you fight, the primordial Lord unknown to knowledge  
Is seen to tremble at the war made by humans.
			
242
			

		
Those who are dazed by compassionate thoughts,  
O brave ones who swim carrying the given mantra,  
The servant who received the mantra and the boy who gave the kiss,  
Only the twelve who are distressed sing and come forth.
			
243
			

		
Annaikarppa room, inside it as precious gold  
Entered into that room, rare and beautiful form  
When standing aligned, blocking the way and coming out  
Gave golden honor and grew up as the leader.
			
244
			

		
May there be no time to forget you,  
May there be no test that freezes the heart and hides the soul,  
O God who has no form, yet is called golden light,  
Grant me the gift of being born without gold.
			
245
			

		
Even if it pleases you, O mighty beings who hold grudges,  
If you halt caste discrimination leaving aside distinctions,  
If you, mighty ones, can speak the truth about the oppressed,  
The startled Lord will come along without fail.
			
246
			

		
You are sound, you are kindness, you are the sound of hesitation  
You are accomplishment, you are Shiva, you are the sacred syllable  
You are liberation, you are the first, you are the triune deity  
Within Athipuram, one will understand and know you.
			
247
			

		
Wrapped up and sleeping soundly, O cunning crafty one  
Softly closing your mouth and speaking lies, O deceiver  
What is long life or wisdom? The wet letter  
What is fame? Speak, O sinful deceitful one?
			
248
			

		
When the true firefly was a means,  
Turning white and flying in the water was the water itself,  
When drying fruits became formed,  
Pure senses must clarify.
			
249
			

		
Loving deceitful birth within the mind itself  
People who do not know the truth of the letter of fear  
If you are powerful enough to destroy deceitful birth  
You will definitely come to know the truth of the letter of fear.
			
250
			

		
In the dry grove, cooled vehicles  
With untouched honey, you sleep day and night  
The untied boat, near the shore's edge  
Only wisdom that speaks softly with lips.
			
251
			

		
You call them ghosts, the wandering spirits,  
Will they possess ghosts' possession or ghosts' possession?  
Will they possess primordial possession or possession from before time began?  
The painful ghosts, they have calculated it all.
			
252
			

		
In the original source, in the four-cornered square,  
At the four entrances, the reigning ruler chanted the mantra,  
With the shape of a Kolam pattern and the cooled, ripened plaster,  
I do not see anything else that has blossomed except Shiva.
			
253
			

		
In the primal ancient era, in the biorhythm of the morning and evening waters  
The root cause land of the test, the land of honor uttered the born dawn  
The primordial gathering ripped the back, the phoneme mother scripture  
Various births happened, various deaths occurred.
			
254
			

		
With style, the supreme sacred character,
The mantra spoken from the bank of the Ong river,
By cutting the bamboo, stripping the bark, and performing purification rites,
Appears in the studied text and is to be understood clearly.
			
255
			

		
The trial that arose in the middle of Pundareeka
			
The illusionist who rules with the three realms,  
Able to penetrate and understand the universe,  
There is no refusal to surrender to the deity of Kandakovil.
			
256
			

		
Pundareekam - Lotus
			
O cheater who dances in the marketplaces of temples  
O primordial warrior who stands as love within the beloved  
O primordial lord who stands as love among the loving  
O truth itself that stands as truth to all beings.
			
257
			

		
What is it, elder brother? The mantra that was revealed  
The one who came as coolness, the one who learned all scriptures  
The one who came as Kannan, the one praised for the reason  
What is it, my dear? The true mantra?
			
258
			

		
Inside or outside, the life stands trembling
You say I must gently come close and ask?
When inside and outside are alike, it is divine sound
The spell is to open the secret door and see.
			
259
			

		
The immeasurable primordial womb of immeasurable time  
The unblemished love of the unbearable god  
The indivisible universe and the metal-world realms  
What body could have merged and departed, what say you?
			
260
			

		
Within me, where did I run myself away?  
Within me, because of an unknown thirst I did not know myself  
Within me, after knowing myself, after knowing  
Within me, without me, there is nothing at all.
			
261
			

		
From the sky, lightning flashed and flickered like a spark  
Even within me, the Lord who dwells is by my hand  
From the eyes, appearing in the eyes, because of the priceless eye gem  
Even within me, I do not know myself.
			
262
			

		
Even if restrained, the unrestrainable within the heart  
Even if restrained, the uncontrollable love within me  
Even if it exists, even if it remains, even if troubles come  
Even if it happens, the relentless sound of the flute will kill.
			
263
			

		
Mattulavu water channel decorated like an ornament  
At the doorstep, thirst is quenched; on the earth and sky exposed  
With eight and two combined, because of this, the heart  
Will be captive, the joy of love will become a home without walls.
			
264
			

		
Ekamuthi, Moondrumuthi, Naalumuthi, gathering together good deeds,  
Attaining liberation through virtuous acts as pearls,  
Circled by serpents as a bed, crossing the ocean of welfare,  
Performing yagams, O South Koladi Deva, who stood as fire.
			
265
			

		
With thirty-six and thirty-three magically,
Three pearls became three three three magically,
Appearing and shining as three lights, without confusion or flickering,
O Lord of Southern India, who entered our hearts.
			
266
			

		
Five and five and five do not become fifty, but alive among the not-so;  
Five and three become one, the primordial God who stands;  
Five and five and five formed and stood, you who formed and stood;  
Five and five and fifty, none can see like you who stand alive.
			
267
			

		
Six by six, six by six, one five five by five  
Six leaves, two three, seven six, eight by six  
Becoming different knowledge, with truth and falsehood  
Like a soaked sound, O immortal mysterious one.
			
268
			

		
Eight and eight, eightfold, seven and seven, sevenfold  
Eight and one become three, O Primordial God who stands  
Eightfold with feet bowed down, the one who stands  
Those who read the eight letters do not falter, the one who stands firmly.
			
269
			

		
With ten and ten, one with seven is nine,  
By the good fortune gained from the land standing in the ten-four directions,  
With tenfold shoots and the strong binding gum,  
Gathering ten pearls, one after another, it becomes a ritual.
			
270
			

		
Love comes through reading, opposing the South  
Love warmly combines goodness with sins  
Spreading over, the upright shoulder loses its support, the leader fainting  
Cannot forget as desire, becomes immortality.
			
271
			

		
Simply on the wound lies Embran's place  
Neither giving nor receiving is the form and content  
An upright trial stood firm in that place  
In the revealed one alone, Shiva was born.
			
272
			

		
Those who say it is "five letters and three letters" are devotees.  
The meaning of "five letters and three letters" cannot be seen.  
After engraving the five letters in the heart and knowing those letters,  
Both "five letters and three letters" indeed mean Shiva.
			
273
			

		
Not wanting to tell lies because of the liar's shiver
There is no need to speak the truth because of the fear of truthfulness
I feared to reveal the truth in this world
Did it become a cage? O Namachivaya Lord!
			
274
			

		
Even if one kills one and cooks food together  
Even if the gathering changes with many lies  
The one who seeks the pig cannot be convinced, brave one  
That god will surely understand you within.
			
275
			

		
Medicine - Shop
			
Within a drop of musk, the breath that speaks illusion  
From within the soot, one acquires knowledge and awareness  
The desireless Emperor stands everywhere  
After acquiring awareness from within the soot.
			
276
			

		
Like a snake that sheds its skin in the field,  
How can the people of the world live if the truth is not spoken?  
Like a thorn that has sprouted in the fence, truth is not a lie,  
The song that has been worn out was born in hell.
			
277
			

		
Grief - Heartache
			
The ox that is being driven here and there is water forever,  
The sinners who seek it will not understand the clear one;  
The thief who stood confused in the forest village street  
Runs away, and inside you, the sensitive heart watches with feeling.
			
278
			

		
The year that plays and the kalpa after that,
The four Vedas and the three divine ones,
The long-lived spirits and the stable states,
Do they ever cease to exist or disappear? No, they do not.
			
279
			

		
Existence is vast, destruction is vast  
Going is vast, entering is vast  
Gods are vast, directions are vast  
All are vast, and I am also within that vastness.
			
280
			

		
The seven seas, the eight directions with their strength  
Surround the universe spoken of by the eagle over the mountains  
The vast two worlds, one immense and deep, standing firm  
Will retreat before the dawn that rose in the ocean of light.
			
281
			

		
Like water dripping from the edge of a vessel, shall my hands tire and stand still?  
Men without any moisture in their hearts, without wisdom;  
Even if they have moisture in their hearts, they are not able to cleanse the dirt.  
Are the trials we thought of, you and I, not one and the same?
			
282
			

		
Born in water, you perform water rituals  
Half-eaten water, you immerse it there  
Root-eaten seed-eaten sprouts will sprout in the seed  
Oh powerful one, with discipline, you will attain the abode of Shiva.
			
283
			

		
At the grand entrance, the curved corner extending wide,  
The pearl-like wisdom functioning as the source,  
The magnificent magic dance performed by the five-faced Lord,  
The devotees have installed within themselves is Shiva alone.
			
284
			

		
Like an atom paired with its nucleus, the immeasurable trial  
Becomes a remedy if it is inscribed within you, a pearl  
Faltering, if you raise a finger within yourself, again and again  
Every day you intoxicate yourself, adorning with vermilion flowers.
			
285
			

		
Before facing the original fear  
The closing ignorance will close tightly *curtain  
If the fearful timid ghost retreats in fear  
Will it join the temple or will it join the orphan?
			
286
			

		
Becoming a perfect square in all dimensions, ultimately uniting as one,  
Those who are contained by the square of eight corners manifest as letters,  
The true square shines as the lamp of enlightened wisdom,  
The truth of the mantra spoken is none other than Shiva.
			
287
			

		
Like carts, do not remove the dirt from your mind  
Like locks, you will be immersed in the bath  
Your four-faced one of old will fly and seek,  
Those who see him mixed within you will see.
			
288
			

		
There was no standing, no existence, no time, no speech,  
No bond, no home, no faults.  
No fasting, no questioning, no unbearable sky,  
Without end, how can I speak of something that stood?
			
289
			

		
The reason why the agreeing water has entered within you and stayed  
The unity of two oxen that have eaten one calf cannot be separated  
The breath that dies staying close by, you do not know  
What is the form that grows old and roams about? What form indeed?
			
290
			

		
Are you the five-lettered word that roams the sky?  
Are you the sculptor that stood spread like lions?  
Because of the unity of all lives in the body,  
The body and I have always been Shiva.
			
291
			

		
Moist light Mondays have operated till now  
Shining light Mondays, not all are aware of that  
The layer of firelight has also passed till now  
The great stream of light, the sole Lord's path.
			
292
			

		
It won't take, it won't take gently, the crying jumps and stamps  
It won't push, it won't approach, inside the anxious mind  
It won't clear, it won't reveal, the sculptor's inner work  
It won't hold, how can I declare the meaning of the matter?
			
293
			

		
By word, by mind, by respect, by perception,  
Those who direct an undirected gaze, will they look?  
An undirected gaze comes, looking but not seeing,  
An undirected gaze comes, how will it behold the gaze?
			
294
			

		
Though inside and outside, everywhere in the world spreading wide  
Like sesame oil flowing smoothly, the emperor lives and acts  
Gently he comes inside me, after understanding true penance  
What is a benefactor to a benefactor? What is color to color?
			
295
			

		
I have not seen a Veda born without a womb,  
Yet you manifested everywhere in the form of wisdom,  
In the world as light within the probe, intensely with harshness,  
The primal source, the primal one, established as Shiva.
			
296
			

		
If ditch water overflows twice, it will collapse within itself,  
Born and bred in the mud, you will toil,  
If you cannot renounce the five senses, which are like the boat,  
Knowing this, merged as millions, it is only Shiva.
			
297
			

		
If the fifty million mantras rest within Anjule,  
Within your heart, if a single thought resides,  
If the fifty-four become three and rest within you,  
That single letter formed is none other than Shiva.
			
298
			

		
The undecayed unfallen undecayable,
The wheel possessing the Sixteen Possessions and the perfect triple emblem,
Like pure oil any letter emanates,
When imbibed, steadfastness no one can match.
			
299
			

		
The inner essence of the Agama is the infinite source,  
Therefore it is the sublime root beyond decay,  
Within the sacred five letters that reveal the one who rests on the single foot,  
The singular destination was indeed Shiva alone.
			
300
			

		
On the threshold, a sacred syllable exists,  
The four gates, the number finger, the mantra uttered from the middle,  
A single kolam (design) out of five, standing firmly here,  
I have seen nothing else sprouting but Shiva alone.
			
301
			

		
Within the twirling sound of the drum is a letter that spins,  
Within the sound of the akkara is the seated primordial one, the pure Shiva,  
Within the sound of the ukkara is the sensing five letters,  
The akkara has become that which is seated, Shiva alone.
			
302
			

		
Within Kundala resides the noble Lord of Aruthaka,  
The land I have seen, the dance that dispels ignorance,  
The radiant moon shines the true essence,  
The realm witnessed is none other than Shiva.
			
303
			

		
Around five together, one declared the open victory  
Sound and Shiva stood as one, a unity without division  
Truth itself, from the beginning, the radiant truth of compassion  
The fools do not know, the form that was Brahman.
			
304
			

		
In the seed syllable mantra that has sprouted within the five letters,
The four Vedas reside, the nine types of knowledge are true within it.
It must be experienced by one with devotion and by a noble person for this reason,
The mantra called syllable is no other than Shiva, indeed so.
			
305
			

		
Philosophies are like water that dries up over time, O valiant ones  
If philosophy is not supremely pure, it is indeed water, is it not?  
After Lord Muthusivan established the root path  
All those people will understand within you themselves.
			
306
			

		
The origin that uttered thirty-three and the three words  
The wise have said it is the pure path  
Having stated this, nature and letters  
Can be seen shining clearly by those who can perceive.
			
307
			

		
Even if the sky falls and the world ends,  
Even if the land of numbers and the island called naval itself,  
The red gold palace will not shine, the one who dances in the hall,  
The emperor is not a false god, no no not at all.
			
308
			

		
Like five petals standing in a flower,
Like four legs,
Like three excellent feet like fire, like two,
Like seven rays of the sun, with different qualities,
Who can see the steadfastness that does not fade away?
			
309
			

		
In the atmosphere, as one with air, two with moving feet,  
With three in red water, and four as good fire,  
The Lord who sat among the five elements as five,  
Who can see all as clear in their essence?
			
310
			

		
If you are capable of cherishing waters without emotion,  
The lamp of remembrance will stand forever;  
Among all the Vedas that everyone chants, the one free of ego is supreme,  
What is dreamed is true; the clear water is Shiva alone.
			
311
			

		
What is the drum for? Is the Veda there?  
Are there palm-leaf manuscripts in the red clay pot?  
Did the sprout that grew on the broken pillar  
Hold on? O Patthanatha Pattare.
			
312
			

		
The edge of the lotus that sprouted in the water  
Standing together with the water, yet not merging with the water like a banyan  
The scholar's supreme quality that sprouted in sight  
Will you stand together with sight and observe its qualities?
			
313
			

		
I do not sleep, I do not wake, my senses run away,
Are the five great elements and the directions all in one in me?
How can a body with an outer side be consistent?
The realized ones say there is nothing to think about in fullness.
			
314
			

		
Readers read, and the one letter is the same  
That body called Veda was shining then,  
One sound, four-faced Mala, I and the one are the same!  
The honesty that realized the one standing without anything else
			
315
			

		
When the bursting, radiating sun came out,  
Did the metal pierced through like the anvil?  
When it appeared inside the body, the forms shine,  
Taking form on the horn, it was the great, solid design.
			
316
			

		
The earth and the sky came together as follows  
The speckle that mixed with the earth like soot  
The sound with the dew and the fearsome ghost  
Even today, the attraction and repulsion given with the earth.
			
317
			

		
The oppressed one who endured and the one who stood firm,  
one who was in the middle, and the one who climbed midway,  
with the two who stood apart, truthfully or falsely,  
stood close, the knowing one, the orphan, the first.
			
318
			

		
Even in the rising gem and the fading spar,
O Sothinee who hid in the land of Madithaman,
After you died in the land of Madithaman,
What thrived in the land of Sirithaman was none other than Siva.
			
319
			

		
Don't seek the purified holy teacher for approval  
Are you able to bear the teacher who gives criticism?  
The teacher who gives criticism and the disciple who receives it  
The diligently repeated lesson, that is the twelfth and supreme.
			
320
			

		
Awakened eyes praise and the wondrous sound of the Lord,  
The Meru and the past years and planets have all passed by,  
All letters have vanished outside the Indrasala,  
And you alone, the clouded southern deity, are eternal.
			
321
			

		
Om Namo, having known it as a sin forever,  
Having known drinking and eating as sin,  
You and I exist in the prosperous family, it exists indeed,  
Though we eat and drink, realize there is nothing.
			
322
			

		
For those who have overcome the fifty sins, feeding others with food  
Will it rise for the Lord who stood as a friend?  
That fifty sins will never be overcome, they alone will toil  
For those who cheat, both giving and receiving is theirs.
			
323
			

		
Are the five impulses also the same as those?
Is the suffering born in the womb also the same?
Yesterdays tremble, the truth will be realized
Even the food and sleep going to you and me would be the same.
			
324
			

		
The running ambulance rushing through the crowd  
The weeping four-faced one, the swan-knowing sage  
The three qualities of the learned gathered in three letters  
Dancing as the devotee, that is Shiva alone.
			
325
			

		
In the outer world beyond the earth's core of blood,  
The air swells and rises within the flaming lamp,  
The two ascetics, Thavana and Soma, move themselves at the doorway,  
Standing atop the chariot pole, outside in the open.
			
326
			

		
In the silence of the tightened breath, slowly ascending to read,  
After entering the sky-full radiant sphere,  
He and I, dissolved in reality and experienced to the extent,  
He exists, I do not, no one exists, it is I alone.
			
327
			

		
According to the sword is the sword's sheath, according to the mouth is the mouth's cover  
According to the ruler is the ruler's modesty, what a wonderful wisdom to see!  
According to the rhythm is the rhythm's hold, the nature itself is also natural  
According to the day is the day's covering, what you and I have seen.
			
328
			

		
He will crush, he will destroy, he will become a magical form  
He will decay, he will ascend to heaven, time after time  
He will roll, he will move, he will become a pure smoke  
He will taste, he will speak, subtle subtle subtle indeed.
			
329
			

		
The joy of the word spoken by Aagikooven  
Millions of yogis have understood and seen  
Like the earth, the mind-monkey overflows and blooms everywhere  
Uniquely, millions and millions will exist.
			
330
			

		
Crores and crores, the origin of crores of clans  
Day by day, day by day, become vain in a short time  
Searching, searching, seeking, the body also becomes ragged  
Gathering, gathering, standing tall, O crore of crores.
			
331
			

		
The reason for the existence of the mind and the body,  
The reason for the presence and the hiding, the one who is neither both nor one,  
The one who died, the one not dead, the one who perished and disappeared,  
The witness who also shouts within the mind, the primal one who discovered all.
			
332
			

		
Arguer arguer knows the talker  
Blowing blowing, stammering, he will mutter  
Street by street, street by street, he will patiently endure the rebuttal  
Caste by caste, caste by caste, he will see the union.
			
333
			

		
Masculinity, masculinity, masculinity, masculinity, the spirit gathers restlessly  
An invisible mud form, through ages and ages  
Becoming style, becoming silent love it stands  
Becoming modest, at the jaws of death, it twinkles there itself.
			
334
			

		
With the roar of the syllable "mingu"
Sleeping with Soman, transformed into Soman
There, in the tip whirl, becoming one, therefore
You will see the light shining without the Ganga and the sky.
			
335
			

		
The subtle sparkle of firelight and the subtlety of the tip of the tongue  
The subtlety that rises thickly and sits as one  
The subtle sharpness and the subtlety of the twisting tail  
The subtlety of the sea rising—who has understood, O wise one?
			
336
			

		
Dogs called Gnani Gnani by the millions and millions  
Countless clouds on a rainless day, millions and millions  
Ignorant fools who do not see the nature of the ocean  
Countless wise ones who advance without illusions, millions and millions.
			
337
			

		
On a sharp thorn, at the spinning tip's light  
In the commanding wind, at the gate that shines  
On a loud thorn, in the temple where one lived  
On a fierce island, the best is Siva alone.
			
338
			

		
The shining moon and the glowing moon  
The resting moon and the hesitating moon  
The moon that became the Ganges and the biting moon  
The moon that became the crescent and the moon where Shiva resided.
			
339
			

		
On the quiet street at the end of the bend  
On the intoxicated street in the hungry crimson light  
At the wise corner in the doorway where the serpent rests,  
The crimson light that arose is Shiva alone.
			
340
			

		
The tail that rose and stood upright,  
The tail that bit and thrashed,  
The tail that rose and the empty tail,  
The wisdom that rose and then vanished,  
All boiled up, formed a group, and howled fiercely.
			
341
			

		
The cuckoo and the parrot have become mute,  
In the three worlds, the lamp has risen,  
In the flower, like fragrances, the fulfilled one stood,  
Breathing, breathing, the loving heart has looked.
			
342
			

		
O souls who gather, you see the street with Arukkan,  
You see the intangible but cannot destroy corruption,  
The true disputation is smoothly becoming oppressive,  
The sound that acted and stood in the doorway with modesty.
			
343
			

		
In the shadow played and stood at the sacred door  
In the sacred street, in the spreading light  
In the melodious tune, in the stirred-up cuckoo  
The primal one who knows the sacred door is the origin.
			
344
			

		
Aaviavi Aaviavi the spirit of the five tusks  
Mevimevi Mevimevi in the intellect, humans  
Vaavivaavi Vaavivaavi the travelers know  
Paavipaavi Paavipaavi the men trapped in the study.
			
345
			

		
In the knowledge sprouted within the wisdom, amidst the sacred bilva leaves,  
Like a pearl glowing, the silent lamp,  
In the sound, the lord who appears like protection is known,  
At the door lies the subtle serpent personified.
			
346
			

		
The dusk and dawn flow and surge, O silent one  
The dusk and dawn have withered, O anguished beings  
The budding red flame sprouted from the prime corner  
The branch and the blossom remain, O silent one.
			
347
			

		
The sound that stood still on the silent road  
Without hesitation, what speed is that speed?  
In the bough dense in the forest corner  
The wise red flame walked as Shiva.
			
348
			

		
In the caste that flowed on Ucchimathi Street  
Greenish Soman stood broad and wide  
The clean lamp, the meditative one,  
The raw one, the one who has passed is Shiva.
			
349
			

		
Standing on the tusk like a drum, rising up,  
Pure one who blossomed and blossomed with the sprout,  
When the red sun rose, along with the master  
The five elements became one, the silent one who flew and stood.
			
350
			

		
In the strict spear’s philosophy’s nature  
In the firm ash’s flame, in the sacred breath  
In the trunk called unity in the plantation’s light  
In the middle called sound running, it settled well.
			
351
			

		
The desirous moon of Amayi, the virtuous moon of Aran,  
The cooking moon, the spreading moon,  
The rapid moon that bears ice, the shining peak moon,  
The wise people will observe the ceremony carefully.
			
352
			

		
Along the Paichalur route, in the churn that was burning  
At the tip of a fevered spear, in the fruitful mountain  
What was intense? The wideness rests right here  
With breath holding onto breath, a tough test standing still.
			
353
			

		
Some lose repeatedly, called as losers by the world  
Some perpetually dance as the eternal dancers  
Some argue and deceive, known as deceivers  
Justice, justice, justice stands as the full flame.
			
354
			

		
The time when dawn arose brightly  
Before the earth and sky were united as one  
The primordial five elements that stood widely spread  
Stood thickly everywhere as the soul of the universe.
			
355
			

		
The deer that stood still on the ground
Those who perceive it, feel refreshed and wander in love
Will see the vision itself on the highest peak where the sight is clear
The sound of the flowing Kalni river and the joy will be celebrated.
			
356
			

		
The aged red-hot throbbing Lord of Vadinachothi,  
Crying out like wild beasts in the barren land without a refuge,  
Fearlessly today the spread suffering,  
The charming Lord of Nayankoil trembles, O revered lamp.
			
357
			

		
At the flame tip, at Divakar’s glow  
In the angry scream, in the boiling fire  
In the scorching root cooked, the subtlety standing  
The cursed liberation struggled in Lanka.
			
358
			

		
Divakaram - Sunlight
			
The saint circled around the tip of the trident's tail  
Dressed up by the tail, at the base where energy existed  
At the gate filled with the wrath of love's fire  
He stood repeatedly, the silence that expanded and stood still.
			
359
			

		
The bull that stood towering on the silent hillocks  
Becoming fierce and angry, in the midst of the bilva leaves  
What is it that has poured out, the red glow standing firm  
Like the locks of hair and the biting teeth, the sight that stood biting.
			
360
			

		
			
			On the axle at the pinnacle of the wheel's rotation  
			The moonlight shines brightly, surpassing the red flame  
			As a ball on the bilva leaf, the five elements are scattered  
			Like a bird standing on a branch, it makes a sharp cry.
			
361
			

		
With a breath called determination, both cigar and bidi  
Became green, standing as the norm of the open space  
In the desire’s breeze, it arose in the Eeyil  
At the sharpest angle, what rose was Shiva alone.
			
362
			

		
In the six-cornered hall stood the nine elders,  
The shining wise men known like a beacon,  
The silent one who stood holding the five there,  
The vast rock stood firmly, Shiva alone.
			
363
			

		
When it flies, it hardens along the way to Paaycchaloor  
When it is born, it is life—neither woman nor man  
Whether it renounces, is better, or attains purity  
At the time of death, at that moment alone, will go to Siva’s abode.
			
364
			

		
Outside the grace, in the darkness that stands angrily  
In the cycle where meaning exists, on the path that rolled and rose  
In the art that has light, in the net that shone  
From the teacher's path, the breath that emerged.
			
365
			

		
The primal one who remained in a single letter,  
There is no way to perceive it on the scale of rhythm with the forest;  
Indeed, it is the self that formed, like the evening garland in the morning,  
For some reason, the one different with the fire alone was Shiva.
			
366
			

		
The God who formed the six-sided body and stood firm  
Mary who stood dignified and adorned  
The fierce anger and the shining mind  
In the changing village, all have turned to Shiva.
			
367
			

		
At the corner seen by the mouth, the trembling elder is Vai,  
After seeing the color, the lord of heads has frozen,  
After seeing the dry crab, having gone to Karuvur,  
Having said he would jump, what flew was indeed Shiva.
			
368
			

		
When the flown has given up, on the way to Paichalur  
What was forgotten is the feast of the monkey hand that bites  
What was born is when dead, in the ill-fated crow  
The silent one who stood out, what became clear is Shiva.
			
369
			

		
The breath of fire in the posture of Vadivupadma,  
Lifted by the Marudhu wind, the five and four gates,  
Sealed with the pearl of completion, struck by the ancient veena’s staff,  
The sprouting waves will cross Yama and we shall pass through the root nerve.
			
370
			

		
Beginning and ending, crossing the six lands,  
Beyond and outside, crossing the primordial test,  
With eyes that partake of the nectar-drink, in the likeness of true knowledge,  
The yogi who ascends and descends, the supreme yogi.
			
371
			

		
Whether inside or outside, life is trembling and standing still  
You say gently come near and inquire  
When the heart and birth coincide, it is a sound  
O humans, you must open the secret door and see.
			
372
			

		
The embodiment attempting to trouble the pearl nectar  
The five senses awaken as the embers burn  
By the love of Lord Kaalagandar, who is eternal and unchanging  
Recite daily and deeply understand within your mind, O wise one.
			
373
			

		
Three hundred and five, struggled and rose as a divine being  
Three hundred and five, struggling, is the whole world  
Even having reigned, the Father operates as the primal sound  
With one letter that appears, there is nothing else to say.
			
374
			

		
The external excitement and letter of wonder,

The internal excitement with melted ghee and complete purity,

Knowing both in the exterior and those actions,

The clarity that surpassed the external is indeed Shiva.
			
375
			

		
Mantras, learn and you will be enchanted, O enchanters  
When the learned mantras perish, will you speak?  
The mantras reside within you, the honor is also within you  
Mantras are the five letters of the heart.
			
376
			

		
After the three sides, in the three-eyed Shiva's grace  
In the sculptor's art, the sacred salutation to Shiva grows  
The arrow of desire rises and stands everywhere then  
On this side, will it retreat? Everywhere is the Lingam alone.
			
377
			

		
Is the standing god Shiva a fearful five-element being,  
Or a test standing together, or the origin standing in the lineage?  
Is it the land observed while standing, or the speech-less education?  
Having seen the house, I sought and found, becoming the open field.
			
378
			

		
The truth that is firmly and steadily established  
And the correction in it—all is Shiva and the rich consonants.  
When it stands firm and is stabilized in unity,  
That which awakens from thought is the skull-cup held by the Lord.
			
379
			

		
When thought arises, it becomes the lotus throne  
When thought arises, it becomes the cause  
When thought arises, it becomes the two eyes to see  
The one who arose from thought is the Lord who bears the skull.
			
380
			

		
Aanavanni triangle in six hundred and twenty eight strokes  
When the five-letter A is trembled with the letter A  
The truth of the soul and the innocent truth  
Become as such, naturally, and disappear silently.
			
381
			

		
The upright bamboo shoots outside the Embaran temple  
With the mouth of the four-headed serpent to the four directions  
After crossing the three triple entanglements around three sides  
The upright fire smoke stood everywhere.
			
382
			

		
Is there not unity everywhere, in both these two worlds?  
Is there not unity in that and here, in the orphan as well?  
Are not those who provide support and those who endure one?  
In your and our shared portion, it is only Shiva who arose.
			
383
			

		
The sky dances with the fire of the elephant-bodied being.  
The sky and the drum roar without hesitation.  
Diving into the sky's abyss, the body resides.  
In the sky, seated with the primordial one, is Shiva.
			
384
			

		
The unfaded earth blossomed, O swan of the forest path,  
Running and stopping, forming shapes and crying out in pain,  
After the limbs frolicked and withered away,  
Standing together and wandering about was the artful line of the guru.
			
385
			

		
Did it sprout from a cracked seed or did the root melt away  
Did the wandering Shiva stop by and see the moist world?  
Did the ever-shining Sadasiva become a circle of light  
Are those who know the circular kingdom actually sky gods?
			
386
			

		
In the vessel of mankind filled with celestial beings of light  
Among all those, the sky gods are the sky beings who came  
After knowing the heavenly realm and the earthly realm and the circular village  
The sky was filled with gems that were the kings.
			
387
			

		
If you stop for twelve times and gaze at the five colors,
Oh king, when you stand outside and sit elsewhere,
On the red head stands Shiva and moves,
The one who created the universe is the all-pervading Brahman.
			
388
			

		
Where did the highest peak bind the eyes and see the truth?
In the palm of a boy, the deer is mixed with sandalwood.
The deserted gate is studied with singular focus.
The green robe and the Lord spread—the sacred Shiva.
			
389
			

		
From the mouth came the good sound in the ancient script  
From the temple came the bow, and there the nine fingers dried up  
From the mortar came the vegetation, and from the orphan came Shiva  
From the breath came the Vanni tree, and what grew is Shiva alone.
			
390
			

		
Pronouncing the letter as the beginning of the infinite  
Opening the letter and roaring without fear  
After passing through the darkness within the letter  
Sitting with the primal at the letter is Shiva.
			
391
			

		
Temples and ponds become shrines in symbols,  
In illusion and confusion, the mind is bewildered,  
One who understands the body and the soul,  
Will rest peacefully even with mother and father-in-law.
			
392
			

		
Are there no temples everywhere, no ponds and tanks?  
Is there no sacred sacred fire, is there no Shiva there?  
Is there no Lord Shiva who resides everywhere?  
Those who have attained immortal bodies will appear and be seen.
			
393
			

		
Are there not those who have eyes, nose, and mouth together?  
Is there not one that is tested and brings comfort?  
Is there not one whose written scripture arose?  
Those who know the sound-house will surely see the Lord of sound.
			
394
			

		
The letter contained within Avvudhittha  
Since the Savvudhittha mantra was in the samphula  
The mantras are mesmerized by the Mavvudhittha illusion,  
What is elevated by Uvudhittha is indeed the truth.
			
395
			

		
Has the consonant vanished from the letter called Akaara?  
Has the vowel arisen within the Akaara?  
Have the vowel and the consonant stood together as one?  
Oh wise ones without bias, please explain in detail.
			
396
			

		
Truth indeed is with you, the timid one is Lord Shiva within,
The ancestors are not frightened beyond this.
The five elements together speak one clear light,
The pure Shiva has ceased, the stillness is the truth.
			
397
			

		
In the drop of honey, in the vital organ of the brain  
At the three-cornered entrance on the rising mound  
In the true square, in the true cavity, as a shining lamp of wisdom  
The mantra chanted is Om Namah Shivaya.
			
398
			

		
The letter is not without origin, nor is the soul without origin  
The buried spirits and realms are not without origin  
The appropriate texts and scriptures are not without origin  
Stand firm and unite to see the truth, it is without origin.
			
399
			

		
What stood softly left it and touched it?  
Should you speak the truth, are we noble?  
What stood womanly left it and touched it  
The pearl mixed together was the truth to be spoken.
			
400
			

		
If suppressed, will the swollen wound subside?
If broken, realizing the injury as true,
The Vedas fail to quell due to impatience
Will a barking dog stop, or speak differently?
			
401
			

		
Fracture - Mystery
			
			When the true wheel served as a remedy  
			And the cool wound became a dry form  
			When the white banyan stood blossoming  
			It is necessary for the true wise ones to speak out.
			
402
			

		
Like oil spreading everywhere in the corner, the fool wanders alertly in the mind's interior.  
O brave one, who can correct the tail of a thief dog?  
True charity disappears when the wealth that stood as generosity vanishes.
			
403
			

		
In the book that desires and knows "need,"  
You call it "thaanu-undangu," do not scold, do not forget.  
Thaanu is the root land, the inner land, within you,  
Seeing it, no other delusion or illusion arises.
			
404
			

		
You speak routinely, but secretly you yearn inside,
Unusual disputes like sharp arrows and strikes,
The disputes that arise like sharp arrows within you,
You speak routinely, O Lord of hearts and earth.
			
405
			

		
The formless is the altar, the orphaned is the altar  
The sounded is the altar, the true is the altar  
The great is the altar, the shaped is the altar  
The highest is the altar, the clear one is Siva alone.
			
406
			

		
The wheel flew and became a plank on the wheel  
Like oil soaking into red sandalwood, the lion's mouth drips  
The scents mixed with the light in the tusk, mingling turbulently  
How did it become as if it had vanished when it entered the pouch?
			
407
			

		
Oh Kongai that has risen and grown, do not consider it an illusion  
Those who do not bestow grace, you are the true chariot of the world  
If you hear bitter words full of shining wisdom  
The pure heart will be filled with understanding without blemish.
			
408
			

		
Do you know the knowledge that recites the four Vedas?  
The four Vedas together are the complete knowledge of wisdom.  
One must possess that which exists and endures eternally,  
That alone has dwelled in the heart, it is none other than Shiva.
			
409
			

		
Say "circle" and keep it at the end of the phrase  
Where was the feast celebrated every day?  
Among the ten friends, one was wasted in the crowd,  
Fathers, how can we speak about this with consideration?
			
410
			

		
How to stand appropriately to explain,  
How to rise and bless as the beloved Lord,  
Thus blesses the primal eternal,  
Majestic mountains are without thorns like a lion, a deer, and an elephant.
			
411
			

		
The supreme being, who divides even what is not divisible within,
Having lit the lamp of mercy, scattering the dust of ego,
You are the noble one who understands true virtue, the supreme path among paths,
Within you dwells the wisdom to recognize the learned country’s essence.
			
412
			

		
The temple where the supreme being stood watching,  
The temple that stood performing dance, the temple that was intense,  
The temple that was the word, the temple that was the color,  
Whether mortal or divine, the pure one is Shiva alone.
			
413
			

		
Went everywhere, the best red gold temple  
The temple where the orphan stood yesterday and today  
The ultimate temple that will forever exist  
Standing united, the one united is Shiva alone.

As a father, you are justice; you are all things.  
You are thought and clarity; you alone are the pearl of wisdom.  
You are the seeker and the result; you are above all, the Veda.  
You are the mother, you are God; O Lord who rules me.
			
415
			

		
Born once, born again, born and died, the poor ones perished  
Now born, born again, why do you anoint sorrow?  
Then the flower withers away, desire can be removed if possible  
In the sound of the speaking lord, clarity will be seen.
			
416
			

		
Appu - Water
			
The sound that operates once the eightfold connection is made  
The resonance and throat within the eight vessels  
The mantra that penetrates through the void of the empty pen  
In that eight-letter word, the one who resides is Siva.
			
417
			

		
Branbran, you trembling fool called water
How did Embran separate from Bran?
Being Bran itself, being Bran, and being the great world
Only in Bran did the sprouted ancestors see you first.
			
418
			

		
That - conclusion  
No beginning, no end, yet no Veda  
No trial, no speech, the uttermost dust spoken  
No justice, no love, and the uncertain  
After seeing the origin, there is still no awe.
			
419
			

		
Grandfather, when the father sits, recognize it  
Grandfather, the primal love is the father  
Grandfather, after no one is there except you  
Grandfather, no one is there except you, no indeed.
			
420
			

		
A previous letter sprouted and arose as a red flame  
Another letter had a birth wound  
Another letter stood united  
One will understand even that one letter.
			
421
			

		
Gather together, you too will chant the Vedas together  
What is the point of having God inside the cart if it's written?  
The custom that governs the country lies within the four or three sides  
The reality is the command of the mother and father who dance inside the cart.
			
422
			

		
Goat - The place where the joyful dance is performed.
			
The reason why Kaakkai Mookkai Aamaiyar explained is  
by curling the tongue and folding it inward, passing through the wisdom channel,  
the two letters of the vowel 'E' are placed on top,  
and by repeated observation, it became the omnipresent Brahman.
			
423
			

		
Ekkai - Desire
			
When you break the stone that contains sound into pieces  
At the threshold, the ground stone crumbles and trembles  
On the stone set for worship, flowers and water will be offered  
What kind of stone is suitable for Shiva, which stone will you tell me?
			
424
			

		
A mantra that controls and confines water by running it,  
Even if controlled, will the wise reside there?  
The air that moves within the limit,  
Place a circle and examine it carefully.
			
425
			

		
In this town, if you say it doesn't exist, where do you run on your path?  
How does the god live sitting in that town?  
The sound that stood on the ripe mound  
You will understand it well in that ripe grove.
			
426
			

		
A tree with a thorny trunk stood fully bloomed,
The mighty tiger surrounded it fiercely,
The unmarried woman, wearing a red saree, danced in the temple,
Without loudly proclaiming her great affection afterwards.
			
427
			

		
The reborn mango tree is watched over by the ghost,  
If later the mangoes are not eaten because of the smell,  
When surrounded by painful deeds, how will it be?  
Those who were once dear will be like a river flooding the home.
			
428
			

		
The sneezes you held back remain without sickness  
The three walled doors but one visible gateway  
The walled door and the doorpost opened wide  
Within the cheek, the clear cunning god will reveal.
			
429
			

		
It will happen, it will happen, the orphaned matter  
One in a hundred million, from nation to nation, those who can stand united  
The sweet-tongued one can live as a child to you  
Join with the speech, and embrace the watery body, do not grieve.
			
430
			

		
Speech - Strength
			
If one truly wishes to become a child,  
Despite forty percent being present, thinking and lacking,  
The original pulse, the native place is sealed in that water essence,  
With the fluty sound of the eelavar, the divine feet will be reached.
			
431
			

		
If you hold yourself with love and cling to the divine,  
In the true realm where clinging ceases, birth and death are removed.  
Before the fall of the illusions that make the mind waver,  
The actions done scatter; that is the stillness.
			
432
			

		
Pangan - the one who broke Parvati's left side  
Vaasi - wind
			
The good people who say "steadfast" hear and see with their eyes  
The elder lovingly understands and observes  
Earth and shaking sky do not move the one who moves them  
Believing this, our Lord is also in our ocean.
			
433
			

		
The one who remains composed among the eight elements is the thirsty one  
Fire, air, water, earth, and ether become one  
The black cloud mingled with the time, the radiant Lord  
Drowned in the dense fog, understand correctly those who perceive.
			
434
			

		
Those wise ones who realize in thought will receive,
They will fetch with skill what is needed by calling.
To perceive both inwardly and outwardly with awareness as the essence,
Stand clear and bright, and discern the purity fully.
			
435
			

		
The pure virtue, by itself, goes and attains glory  
The pure righteous action can join the ritual, O Lord  
The pure good union in oneself cannot have its form  
The pure knowledge can join all four, it is lasting.
			
436
			

		
Those who associate are called wise by the enlightened ones  
Those who associate are the essence of the fortyfold purity, said by Thillai  
Those who associate are the ones blessed with the divine grace of Shiva's abode  
Upon joining, their actions for four lifetimes become unwavering.
			
437
			

		
The incompetent essentially lack stability in the firm forty percent,  
Ignorant folks wander aimlessly within the realm of the country and town,  
Showing signs to the marked one and inwardly observing, O strong one,  
Only those with a steady metal-like rain armor will attain the truth.
			
438
			

		
Those who have not known the pearl are foolish,  
Isn't the philosophy of war also sinful?  
Like climbing the fold of the pond when the dam is opened,  
Lift and suck the source river rising within the body.
			
439
			

		
After eating and getting up, the region forms three shapes, opening three folds  
Upon climbing the stalk of the sugarcane, nectar comes and descends  
Knowing the four truths, the Lord reveals Himself to the devotees  
He is the essence of life, dwelling within and living as such.
			
440
			

		
Dandhi - Nadi
			
In the land of Akkamoola, blowing the fire gently with love  
Trying in enchanting illusion without ceasing  
O thirsty land, like many waters  
The wise prayed with one heart and love.
			
441
			

		
Knowing and seeing, within You is the endless.
Without being born, possessing the sole path is truth.
Having known, they did not abandon it; death they endured.
You, who reside within, open the door of the highest peak.
			
442
			

		
If you have the strength to look within yourself as a test,  
The wicked song will come and strike.  
The one who sits and resolves in the primal wheel,  
Fear not, understand and correct your life.
			
443
			

		
Those who have pure minds as divine Siva and divine Uma  
Long for the fragrance that rises in the forest at night  
All the tears that fall and rise on the bud  
Appear as the darkness before dawn and are seen perfectly.
			
444
			

		
Parithi - Sun Angi - Fire
			
Look at how the Lord who holds the conch shell resides,  
You join in understanding the just and pure essence,  
Even the root and tip hasten to reach and cling to the garland,  
Look well, such a thing has never been born or seen in the sky.
			
445
			

		
Maal - Thirumal Paar - The world split - Dug
			
You say it is like a metal bracelet that cannot be seen,  
Can the king remain as a weakling because of a slight offense?  
If only you serve with love and devotion, brave one,  
The whole Pandiya kingdom that has risen from ancient times will prevail.
			
446
			

		
Finally, he is gone; I have never seen the one before him.  
Can one who has nothing hold on to something?  
If learned, would not one see the grace of God?  
Listen lovingly and affectionately to the noble name.
			
447
			

		
The moment you find the position you have waited for,  
The boredom of faded philosophy will also be removed.  
The light that shines inside the house and outside will be seen,  
The gathered Marutham wind will awaken the koel from its nest.
			
448
			

		
Can one make the original land like this by writing?  
The mighty ones defend the unblemished assembly like water.  
Spinning and passing through the dream, thereafter  
Pressing a letter, establishing the truth is the reality, Ayyane.
			
449
			

		
If it is said to be nothingness, then the soul is matter,  
The good Lord, who sets the rhythm, and the sound,  
If ever love and the flute within lament,  
It will be a trouble, a consequence, and will distance far away.
			
450
			

		
That which is alive is called life, that which is lifeless is animal passion  
The flowers that have bloomed, the plains, and the deeds  
If you place them in the forest, did the wind come and shake them?  
In the desert, only a single breath of air roams around.
			
451
			

		
When the breeze and the gust arise and stand trembling,  
The breeze and the elements will remain on one side,  
The moon will lovingly stay there and create nectar,  
May the breeze understand our Lord and worship Him.
			
452
			

		
In the heart that bows, the cave dweller too believes,  
Trusting the place, we seek the land,  
Emperor and mother both stand in the middle,  
Like a pledge, the promise continues and laziness departs.
			
453
			

		
The questions full of profound knowledge you wield,  
The arrogant desire and the obstructed path,  
From within Omkara arise the nine forms,  
As the speaker said, the fearless one is pure.
			
454
			

		
The time of turmoil was the reason I stood still  
Was it in the melting moment that I realized you?  
In all times when my tears were hidden and my grief was intertwined  
When it melted and stopped, were you and I one?
			
455
			

		
Wisdom seekers who continued searching for spiritual texts,  
Do not recognize the wise disciple within the pulse,  
After knowing the knower who becomes wisdom itself,  
There is no other truth besides wisdom, the courage we spoke of.
			
456
			

		
Before understanding, where did the wound stand?  
Before perceiving, where did life stand?  
In the mind filled with confusion, where did the dizziness stand?  
The knowing ones who felt desire must explain at length.
			
457
			

		
The seven appearances taken at conception
Born and striving due to fear of duality,
After distinguishing the three times of rebirth,
The wise one understands and speaks the benefit of the formed entity.
			
458
			

		
At the mouth's threshold, go, drink water and spit,
What use is a threshold if the mouth exists, where is the place?
Is it not the threshold at the mouth, the mantra that dissolves water?
When the dog is known, what use is a nation's threshold?
			
459
			

		
The creatures that begin as water droplets  
Where did it begin? Where did it become pure?  
If you know the origin and can purify it  
You will not continue to face endless trials.
			
460
			

		
If intellect and desire were to unite in a wound  
Would caste discrimination sting like six calamities  
If Veda and sky were to clash and meet  
What is the use of speaking of differences that do not exist at birth?
			
461
			

		
Mead - Bull
			
Speaking according to their caste groups, the people who argue
Only after realizing the honesty of the entire community of the caste,
The great suffering of that day, have never seen anything else
To mock, they compose letters that burn hearts day after day.
			
462
			

		
Four Vedas and the spoken scriptures  
The Agamas containing spiritual powers  
Caste-based truths and hesitant texts  
All these arose, flourished, and existed with distinctions.
			
463
			

		
You perform endless worship with sacred water on the Shiva Lingam  
O chest adorned with Shiva Lingam where you sit  
You run everywhere, everywhere you vanish after calming down  
O fool who admires all the bricks, red copper, and stones.
			
464
			

		
Flame by flame, water daily immerses, O blind one  
Is it not that when it assembles, it becomes a sore?  
The closed wound within you, the praised spirit  
Has come burning, the clear one is Sivaiyam.
			
465
			

		
Above the axle, four and three om namas,
Phantom who pours water saying sandhi sandhi,
Passing through the main channel within us three hundred and fifty,
That sandhi-less place, understand and see carefully.
			
466
			

		
Van 33 fire in which we live, our Lord too  
Where did the chaste one joyously fall in love?  
Chennai four hands two in thought one out of two  
Our Unni within us, awaken and see.
			
467
			

		
Serving, you too run around and get entangled  
Having lived, you do not empathize and understand  
Our Lord who lives in the grove of Vandalavu  
Is the God who will judge you justly as in the past.
			
468
			

		
To the Supreme, I have no other fear, dear Pariya,  
It is your duty to always shower grace,  
O Lord, who tasted nectar after enduring hardships,  
The right you gave me is truth, truth, and only truth.
			
469
			

		
In my heart, I ran seeking myself everywhere  
In my heart, without myself, I saw nothing at all  
Like the flash and flicker of lightning in the sky  
Inside me, there is neither God nor I.
			
470
			

		
Having cleaned and placed in order, on the placed platform itself  
You will apply fragrant powder and perform offerings  
Where is the modest lord who withdraws and is impelled with wisdom?  
Where does it restrain? Knowing this, one will perform the ritual.
			
471
			

		
Carrying books, scatter falsehoods.  
Do not know where death is born from.  
If you can understand all that thought and look,  
In virtue, the weariness felt will become pleasure.
			
472
			

		
Born out of grace, taking the form of illusion,  
The poor people hesitating in darkness, do you see?  
Those who have endured hardship in wealth and tried to tolerate,  
What is that grace? The hidden one of the Vanniyar is Shiva alone.
			
473
			

		
Self-thought is the quality of a self possessed without renunciation,  
Deeds-thought is a harsh granule eroded by the sun and lost of meaning,  
Even if seeking pure wealth, a wealth unclear,  
Should be graciously seen and accepted in you as a virtue.
			
474
			

		
O learned ones who aspire to the shepherd with a deceitful heart, listen.  
When the deceit within is dispelled, will you not then see the truth?  
If the inner self shines constantly illuminating, you cannot approach it without strength.  
Pure knowledge within you is the greatest, it is Shiva alone.
			
475
			

		
To see, you will climb the seas and mountains  
Isn't that pride of ignorant people?  
If you want, that barefoot sage will give true knowledge  
The Shiva who stood as a pillar will become your Shiva.
			
476
			

		
Thaanu - Metaphor
			
If you look within yourself and correct the immeasurable test that cannot be measured with an atom,  
It will become a pearl.  
If you count your fingers and hesitate and faint again,  
Without courage, you will continue to worship the steps.
			
477
			

		
Poor people who are always crushed between narrow spaces  
Isn't it purity when it is not a narrow space?  
Is there honey in a narrow space, or a flower on a railroad track?  
Even with a helping hand, curdled milk in a narrow space!
			
478
			

		
Sudha - The Cow's Udder
			
The one who searches for the Deertthalinga Murthi is Deethare,  
The seeker who has the Deertthalinga within will realize Shiva,  
If the Deertthalinga is within you, you can clearly see it,  
The Deertthalinga itself is the best and supreme Shiva.
			
479
			

		
Like a bull sitting and speaking,
Suddenly spreading the sought copper plate,
The young lord who roars is within us,
What is worship, what is worship, what worship?
			
480
			

		
O Lord who never forgets me even for a moment  
The One and Only God, King of Kings, Ruler of Kings  
May I remain pure every moment for You  
Your name helps on my tongue, O Lord.
			
481
			

		
Limitless light stood united to burn,  
Vallabhoora Napprakasar united in joy,  
Good pleasure as silence pressed in the blood,  
There is nectar without limits on the day I am lost and stood.
			
482
			

		
Thus, the boundless trial given by the mother  
Revealing the lack within, can you bear it well within yourself?  
You may rule over sickness, you may rule over the world's burden  
You may rule over the forest land; the Vanniyar man is the ruler.
			
483
			

		
Always standing at the corner of the clock's face,  
Who is that person crying loudly with closed eyes?  
No matter how many people you count, is it eight or ten?  
Can the ignorant people accept all that?
			
484
			

		
The deity Lingam that unites the eight and eighteen,  
Only You are capable of respectfully seeing within Yourself.  
My difficult birth can cross the dark ocean,  
With the placed light, You are harmonized, O Formless One.
			
485
			

		
The true mantra resides in light  
The cool mantra takes the form of food  
The white mantra naturally flourishes and spreads  
The true mantra is none other than Siva.
			
486
			

		
At the roof of the mouth, like a thousand peaks  
The three fires fiercely burning and rising  
Where did the crescent moon stand tall and grow?  
How did this fire and the senses become one?
			
487
			

		
481. Ekan - The unique one
			
The gate that shut the powerful gate nine times  
The speaking gate that denied speaking five times and stood still  
After opening the good gate and passing through the gate of wisdom  
After seeing the ultimate gate, there is no birth of sweetness.
			
488
			

		
The honey that came with the fragrance of the sandalwood flowers  
Is contained within, as if woven through the stem  
Seeing and seeing, let it reach the roots, O mighty one  
Siva, who flies away carrying the ancient good deeds.
			
489
			

		
A single letter flows as a link inside a hand  
Know the truth that a single letter functions  
The three letters sprouted as three challenges  
The four letters in the tongue blossom as Shiva.
			
490
			

		
Far and far, the distance that stretches on,
The sinners who stood enduring as the supreme!
At times, if only you could think,
The far and far distances would unite.
			
491
			

		
You bathe in ponds filled with fragrant water,  
Like frogs in water, free from the dirt of the mind;  
Lifting your head and hands, O strong-minded one,  
You will live devoted to your lord forever.
			
492
			

		
Mandugam - Frog
			
Like a herd huddling and sheltering together,  
Twelve goats graze in the same pen;  
O human cattle eating butter while housed!  
After finding a home, one also sees the clearing to cut.
			
493
			

		
The deity of the stone altar, said by all four clans
Circling around and chanting the spell, what is it?
Can even the stone altar speak if the Lord is within?
Will the red-hot griddle ever know the taste of meat?
			
494
			

		
I am not, you are not, Natha is not, I will recite  
It is not the sky, not a test, the test is within us  
If you and I are the same, will the clock be seen?  
Is it of itself, given by itself, is it the grandfather, is it itself?
			
495
			

		
Neither good nor bad, standing in the middle is one thing  
If you say it is good, it becomes good after standing as good  
If you say it is not good but bad, it becomes bad, therefore  
We must stand by saying it is good.
			
496
			

		
Ghosts gather and diseases spread in the loveless forest  
Dogs dance around, is such a life worth believing in?  
If mothers' milk is sought to be denied, avoiding desire  
Then what is the point of toiling in sickness, you who look within.
			
497
			

		
Friend - Lord
			
In the body, you are the stream that will dissolve salt,  
Is craving for alcohol ignorance or a saying?  
A mind clouded with falsehoods loses honor and becomes a slapping demon;  
Truth alone is the path that becomes the silver shore without craving.
			
498
			

		
Birth is followed by death, fools do not understand this  
They happily claim that there is no death, considering us and you as property  
With elaborate words, eagerly coming and going, what is it?  
When the full moon is gone, is it love, O God?
			
499
			

		
The proud, calm, and beautiful woman of Madimukha  
Does not understand the planned trap, looking longingly, Madavalir  
Do you know the pithalattam where the snake curls in the box?  
Why see the dispute collapsing and becoming vile in the spectacle?
			
500
			

		
Reading the Vedas is a waste if it doesn’t lead to action!
Is it necessary to have a distant love flower without love?
The primal lord has butter; do we have it within us?
Which Veda will speak about the flower of desire within you?
			
501
			

		
Where is the supreme non-existence? Where is the supreme existence?  
For the sinner without righteousness, there is no supreme; this is the truth;  
Even if there is substance and body, without grace,  
Supreme non-existence will be emptiness and become a ruined hell.
			
502
			

		
Those whose shoulders do not bear the burden of a mother are not in the earthly realm!  
When the mother's shoulder is wounded, human life prospers,  
Because of the principle that becomes a mother and is upheld by a firm truth,  
The blue Ganges that becomes a mother rejoiced, O Lord.
			
503
			

		
Neelagangai - The Ganges with a blue color.
			
The Shaivas who are known as Siddhars and as the little ones!
When Siddhars were here, you think they were crazy!
Even though Siddhars are here, see what madness prevails?
All those days and these days, everything is the same for them.
			
504
			

		
When human life is forgotten on earth,  
Only the one who can calm the restless spirit in the sky  
Becomes the king and can witness the pure path of truth.  
No bond or angle can ever mark the pure steadfastness.  
Mandru - assembly; Sabha - gathering; Vimalan - one without impurity.
			
505
			

		
Shrug - Fallen leaf.
			
The ascetic who drinks water sparingly and lives a disciplined life!  
In sparing water, bodily ailments arise;  
With the coming, they eat and give, and the household prospers—O joy of life,  
The coming one is Shiva, who lives and provides life.
			
506
			

		
Even after removing Kaadumedu, Kunrupallam, Kaaninaa River,  
Who will see the path of the lord who left the land and country?  
Even after gathering and expanding the air, looking towards Koothanoor,  
There are no free people in the house given by compassion.
			
507
			

		
The god who creates by a stick, the god who creates by a stone,  
The god who creates by a measuring scale, the god who creates by turmeric,  
The god who creates by a thread, the god who creates by cow dung,  
There is no other god outside of the open field.
			
508
			

		
If your own body falls ill, offer yourself at the temple  
Light the Pongal and perform the fowl and turmeric sacrifices  
Speak kindly, be virtuous, fasting daily till the full moon  
Your family deity is none other than you who melts hearts.
			
509
			

		
Desiring daily to dishonestly steal others' belongings,  
Those who rove about without rest,  
The sinner who performs rituals with consecrated items to fulfill desires,  
It is true that they await seven hells in Kasin.
			
510
			

		
Having embraced and anointed with love, applying sandalwood paste generously,  
With fragrance worn on the forehead adorned with Maithilakam,  
Avoiding lies and deceit completely, O foolish ones,  
O maidens with fair complexions flushed with ruddiness, the mane becomes elongated.
			
511
			

		
I will argue that silver and gold with a high carat value  
are enough to provide the golden trappings of a guru-crowned person.  
To achieve the greatness, having wealth and gifts is one thing,  
but seeing one run great distances is also a rare treasure.
			
512
			

		
The yoga master will show the height and rise up  
Quickly snapping and learning skills finely  
With desire, if caught in the mother's urine pot  
It's scary, like the one who is caught in the great world, O friend.
			
513
			

		
Those who eat dry fruits are respected,  
Where is the deceit in doing so, bad are those who fold,  
By chewing ganja straight, they enjoy the real bliss,  
Like dogs barking, in this land the waves roam wild.
			
514
			

		
A wound that does not bubble on water is a true wound,  
One who rallies the town and becomes a leader,  
I will grant you wisdom and enlightenment in justice,  
At the right time, others will hold on to things at length.
			
515

Paavi Enna Veedelam Parukkaikettu Alavaarai.

I will first show the spiritual powers of the pearl-union here for all to see,  
The one who has mastered the divine Vedas everywhere by speaking truths,  
Who daily nurtures the stomach and intellect by speaking of justice and wisdom,  
Should never misuse the sacred commitments and wealth, nor fall into ruinous hell.

On the Semmaiseer tree, you make idol heads  
On the branch without a twig, you cut the foot and destroy  
You cannot look for the one who shines with swelling pride  
This hill, that hill, and the other hill are not alike.

Musical notes run everywhere, in countless rivers,  
Who are the pure sages who immerse their heads all around?  
Sinners who neither repent nor bow with vows;  
Beyond salvation, they drown in the hell of waste, alas.

On the banks where limestone, silver, and copper dry up,  
Valladeva adorned and praised that form,  
Would you say there is great pleasure in troubles?  
No no no no, there is no divine command.

This world, Saturn, and Shiva — in five letters  
Likes, averages, grow — in five letters  
Many living beings flourish — in five letters  
Certain true wisdom stands — in five letters.

Because the blind man only looks at the scriptures,
The blind cannot make the eyes straight and clear.
Even knowing the vessel, the fool cannot worship,
According to the rules, all are pure; thus it is.
			
522
			

		
Unwavering humility, the chained barns of inferiority  
Collecting the belongings of others in anger  
Daily wandering restlessly around the village  
Among the people, many are sinners devoid of joy.

Sivayavasi means all beings in the world  
Sivayavasi means it is also possible to say  
Sivayavasi means the sky can rule  
Sivayavasi itself will become the sacrificial fire.
